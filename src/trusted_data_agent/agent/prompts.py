G2PLOT_GUIDELINES = """
--- **G2Plot Charting Guidelines** ---
- **Core Concept**: You create charts by mapping columns from the data you have received to visual properties.
- **CRITICAL CHARTING RULE**: When you call the `viz_createChart` tool, you **MUST** provide the `data` argument. The value for this argument **MUST BE THE EXACT `results` ARRAY** from the previous successful tool call. Do not modify or re-create it.
- **Your Task**: You must provide the `chart_type`, a `title`, the `data` from the previous step, and the `mapping` argument.
- **The `mapping` Argument**: This is the most important part. It tells the system how to draw the chart.
  - The `mapping` dictionary keys are the visual roles (e.g., `x_axis`, `y_axis`, `color`).
  - The `mapping` dictionary values **MUST BE THE EXACT COLUMN NAMES** from the data you are passing.

- **Example Interaction (Single Series)**:
  1. You receive data: `{"results": [{"Category": "A", "Value": 20}, {"Category": "B", "Value": 30}]}`
  2. Your call to `viz_createChart` **MUST** look like this:
     ```json
     {{
       "tool_name": "viz_createChart",
       "arguments": {{
         "chart_type": "bar",
         "title": "Category Values",

- **Example Interaction (Multi-Series Line Chart)**:
  1. You receive data with a categorical column to group by (e.g., `workloadType`).
  2. To create a line chart with a separate colored line for each `workloadType`, you **MUST** include the `color` key in your mapping.
  3. Your call to `viz_createChart` **MUST** look like this:
     ```json
     {{
       "tool_name": "viz_createChart",
       "arguments": {{
         "chart_type": "line",
         "title": "Usage by Workload",
         "data": [...],
         "mapping": {{
           "x_axis": "LogDate",
           "y_axis": "Request Count",
           "color": "workloadType"
         }}
       }}
     }}
     ```

- **Common Chart Types & Their Mappings**:
  - **`bar` or `column`**: Best for comparing numerical values across different categories.
    - Required `mapping` keys: `x_axis`, `y_axis`.
    - Use `color` to create grouped or stacked bars.
  - **`line` or `area`**: Best for showing trends over a continuous variable, like time.
    - Required `mapping` keys: `x_axis`, `y_axis`.
    - Use `color` to plot multiple lines on the same chart.
  - **`pie`**: Best for showing the proportion of parts to a whole.
    - Required `mapping` keys: `angle` (the numerical value), `color` (the category).
  - **`scatter`**: Best for showing the relationship between two numerical variables.
    - Required `mapping` keys: `x_axis`, `y_axis`.
    - Use `color` to group points by category.
    - Use `size` to represent a third numerical variable.
