You are a helpful assistant that organizes lists of technical tools for a **Teradata database system** into logical categories for a user interface. Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object. The keys should be the category names, and the values should be an array of tool names belonging to that category.

--- Tool List ---
- base_readQuery: Executes a SQL query to read from the database.
- base_writeQuery: Executes a SQL query to write to the database.
- base_tableDDL: Display table DDL definition.

- dba_flowControl: Get the Teradata flow control metrics.
- dba_featureUsage: Get the user feature usage metrics.
- dba_userDelay: Get the Teradata user delay metrics.
- dba_tableUsageImpact: Measure the usage of a table and views by users, this is helpful to understand what user and tables are driving most resource usage at any point in time.
- dba_sessionInfo: Get the Teradata session information for user.
- qlty_missingValues: Get the column names that having missing values in a table.
- qlty_negativeValues: Get the column names that having negative values in a table.
- qlty_distinctCategories: Get the destinct categories from column in a table.
- qlty_standardDeviation: Get the standard deviation from column in a table.
- qlty_columnSummary: Get the column summary statistics for a table.
- qlty_univariateStatistics: Get the univariate statistics for a table.
- qlty_rowsWithMissingValues: Get the rows with missing values in a table.
- rag_setConfig: 
        Set the configuration for the current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) session.
        This MUST be called before any other RAG-related tools.

        The following values are hardcoded:
        - query_table = 'user_query'
        - query_embedding_store = 'user_query_embeddings'
        - model_id = 'bge-small-en-v1.5'

        You only need to provide the database locations:
        - query_db: where user queries and query embeddings will be stored
        - model_db: where the embedding model metadata is stored
        - vector_db + vector_table: where PDF chunk embeddings are stored

        Once this configuration is set, all other RAG tools will reuse it automatically.
        
- rag_storeUserQuery: Store a user's natural language question as the first step in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow.This tool should always be run **before any embedding or similarity search** steps.It inserts the raw question into a Teradata table specified by `db_name` and `table_name`. If the question starts with the prefix '/rag ', the prefix is automatically stripped before storage. Each question is appended as a new row with a generated ID and timestamp.If the specified table does not exist, it will be created with columns: `id`, `txt`, and `created_ts`.Returns the inserted row ID and cleaned question text.This tool is **only needed once per user question** â€” downstream embedding and vector search tools can then reference this ID or re-use the stored question text.
- rag_tokenizeQuery: Tokenizes the latest user-submitted question using the tokenizer specified in the current RAG configuration. This tool must be used *after* calling 'configure_rag' (to initialize the config) and 'store_user_query' (to capture a user question). It selects the most recent row from the query table (e.g., 'pdf_topics_of_interest'), runs it through the ONNX tokenizer, and creates a temporary view '<query_db>.v_topics_tokenized' containing 'id', 'txt', 'input_ids', and 'attention_mask'. This view is used downstream to generate vector embeddings for similarity search.
- rag_createEmbeddingView: Generates sentence embeddings for the most recent tokenized user query using the model specified in the RAG configuration. Reads from the view `<db>.v_topics_tokenized` and applies the ONNX model from `<model_db>.embeddings_models`. Creates or replaces the view `<db>.v_topics_embeddings` which includes the original input and a `sentence_embedding` column. This must be run *after* create_tokenized_view and before vector_to_columns().
- rag_createQueryEmbeddingTable: Converts the sentence embedding from the view `v_topics_embeddings` into 384 vector columns using `ivsm.vector_to_columns`. Creates or replaces a physical table to store the latest query embeddings for use in similarity search. The table location is defined via `rag_set_config`. This tool must be run *after* `create_embedding_view` and before `semantic_search_chunks`.
- rag_semanticSearchChunks: Retrieve top-k most relevant PDF chunks for the user's latest embedded query. This tool is part of the RAG workflow and should be called after the query has been embedded. If the RAG config has not been set, use `rag_set_config` first to define where queries, models, and chunk embeddings are stored. Uses cosine similarity via `TD_VECTORDISTANCE` to compare embeddings. Each result includes similarity score, chunk text, page number, chunk number, and document name.
- sec_userDbPermissions: Get permissions for a user.
- sec_rolePermissions: Get permissions for a role.
- sec_userRoles: Get roles assigned to a user.
- reconnect_to_database: Reconnect to the Teradata database if the connection is lost.
- fs_setFeatureStoreConfig: Set or update the feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- fs_getFeatureStoreConfig: Display the current feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- fs_isFeatureStorePresent: Check if a feature store is present in the specified database.
- fs_featureStoreContent: Returns a summary of the feature store content. Use this to understand what data is available in the feature store
- fs_getDataDomains: List the available data domains. Requires a configured `db_name`  in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- fs_getFeatures: List the list of features. Requires a configured `db_name` and  `data_domain` in the feature store config. Use this to explore the features available .
- fs_getAvailableDatasets: List the list of available datasets.Requires a configured `db_name` in the feature store config.Use this to explore the datasets that are available .
- fs_getFeatureDataModel: Return the schema of the feature store.Requires a feature store in the configured database (`db_name`).
- fs_getAvailableEntities: List the available entities for a given data domain. Requires a configured `db_name` and `data_domain` and  `entity` in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- fs_createDataset: Create a dataset using selected features and an entity from the feature store. The dataset is created in the specified target database under the given name. Requires a configured feature store and data domain. Registers the dataset in the catalog automatically. Use this when you want to build and register a new dataset for analysis or modeling.
- get_cust_activeUsers: Fetch currently active database users
- get_td_serverInfo: Get the Teradata software information: demonstrates how to use parameters for prepared statements.
- get_cube_cube_db_space_metrics: 
    Tool to query the cube 'table_skew_pct'.

2025-07-27 15:03:19,744 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: e61afd56-6693-448c-8269-cded90544bde) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- After successfully gathering data with Teradata tools, consider if a visualization would enhance the answer.
- Use a chart tool if it provides a clear summary (e.g., bar chart for space usage, pie chart for distributions).
- Do not generate charts for simple data retrievals that are easily readable in a table.
- When you use a chart tool, tell the user in your final answer what the chart represents.

--- **Response Formatting** ---
-   **To execute a tool:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
-   **To execute a prompt:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `prompt_name` and `arguments`.
-   **Clarifying Question:** Only ask if information is truly missing.

2025-07-27 15:03:21,431 - --- RESPONSE ---
Thought:The user requests a chart outlining system utilization.  There's no single prompt to fulfill this request, so I need to synthesize a plan using available tools.  The `dba_resusageSummary` tool seems appropriate to retrieve the necessary utilization data.  Since charting is disabled, I will only return the data.

- `rag_setConfig`: 
        Set the configuration for the current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) session.
        This MUST be called before any other RAG-related tools.

        The following values are hardcoded:
        - query_table = 'user_query'
        - query_embedding_store = 'user_query_embeddings'
        - model_id = 'bge-small-en-v1.5'

        You only need to provide the database locations:
        - query_db: where user queries and query embeddings will be stored
        - model_db: where the embedding model metadata is stored
        - vector_db + vector_table: where PDF chunk embeddings are stored

        Once this configuration is set, all other RAG tools will reuse it automatically.
        
- `rag_storeUserQuery`: Store a user's natural language question as the first step in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow.This tool should always be run **before any embedding or similarity search** steps.It inserts the raw question into a Teradata table specified by `db_name` and `table_name`. If the question starts with the prefix '/rag ', the prefix is automatically stripped before storage. Each question is appended as a new row with a generated ID and timestamp.If the specified table does not exist, it will be created with columns: `id`, `txt`, and `created_ts`.Returns the inserted row ID and cleaned question text.This tool is **only needed once per user question** â€” downstream embedding and vector search tools can then reference this ID or re-use the stored question text.
- `rag_tokenizeQuery`: Tokenizes the latest user-submitted question using the tokenizer specified in the current RAG configuration. This tool must be used *after* calling 'configure_rag' (to initialize the config) and 'store_user_query' (to capture a user question). It selects the most recent row from the query table (e.g., 'pdf_topics_of_interest'), runs it through the ONNX tokenizer, and creates a temporary view '<query_db>.v_topics_tokenized' containing 'id', 'txt', 'input_ids', and 'attention_mask'. This view is used downstream to generate vector embeddings for similarity search.
- `rag_createEmbeddingView`: Generates sentence embeddings for the most recent tokenized user query using the model specified in the RAG configuration. Reads from the view `<db>.v_topics_tokenized` and applies the ONNX model from `<model_db>.embeddings_models`. Creates or replaces the view `<db>.v_topics_embeddings` which includes the original input and a `sentence_embedding` column. This must be run *after* create_tokenized_view and before vector_to_columns().
- `rag_createQueryEmbeddingTable`: Converts the sentence embedding from the view `v_topics_embeddings` into 384 vector columns using `ivsm.vector_to_columns`. Creates or replaces a physical table to store the latest query embeddings for use in similarity search. The table location is defined via `rag_set_config`. This tool must be run *after* `create_embedding_view` and before `semantic_search_chunks`.
- `rag_semanticSearchChunks`: Retrieve top-k most relevant PDF chunks for the user's latest embedded query. This tool is part of the RAG workflow and should be called after the query has been embedded. If the RAG config has not been set, use `rag_set_config` first to define where queries, models, and chunk embeddings are stored. Uses cosine similarity via `TD_VECTORDISTANCE` to compare embeddings. Each result includes similarity score, chunk text, page number, chunk number, and document name.
- `sec_userDbPermissions`: Get permissions for a user.
- `sec_rolePermissions`: Get permissions for a role.
- `sec_userRoles`: Get roles assigned to a user.
- `reconnect_to_database`: Reconnect to the Teradata database if the connection is lost.
- `fs_setFeatureStoreConfig`: Set or update the feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- `fs_getFeatureStoreConfig`: Display the current feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- `fs_isFeatureStorePresent`: Check if a feature store is present in the specified database.
- `fs_featureStoreContent`: Returns a summary of the feature store content. Use this to understand what data is available in the feature store
- `fs_getDataDomains`: List the available data domains. Requires a configured `db_name`  in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- `fs_getFeatures`: List the list of features. Requires a configured `db_name` and  `data_domain` in the feature store config. Use this to explore the features available .
- `fs_getAvailableDatasets`: List the list of available datasets.Requires a configured `db_name` in the feature store config.Use this to explore the datasets that are available .
- `fs_getFeatureDataModel`: Return the schema of the feature store.Requires a feature store in the configured database (`db_name`).
- `fs_getAvailableEntities`: List the available entities for a given data domain. Requires a configured `db_name` and `data_domain` and  `entity` in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- `fs_createDataset`: Create a dataset using selected features and an entity from the feature store. The dataset is created in the specified target database under the given name. Requires a configured feature store and data domain. Registers the dataset in the catalog automatically. Use this when you want to build and register a new dataset for analysis or modeling.
- `get_cust_activeUsers`: Fetch currently active database users
- `get_td_serverInfo`: Get the Teradata software information: demonstrates how to use parameters for prepared statements.
- `get_cube_cube_db_space_metrics`: 
    Tool to query the cube 'table_skew_pct'.
    Get the Teradata database space metrics for tables and databases

    Expected inputs:

[model]: Understood. I will follow all instructions.
[user]: please outline the system utilization using a chart
[model]: Thought:The user requests a chart outlining system utilization.  There's no single prompt to fulfill this request, so I need to synthesize a plan using available tools.  The `dba_resusageSummary` tool seems appropriate to retrieve the necessary utilization data.  Since charting is disabled, I will only return the data.

2025-07-27 15:03:23,086 - --- RESPONSE ---
FINAL_ANSWER:The following table shows the Teradata system resource usage summary, aggregated by hour of day and day of week.  The metrics include request count, CPU time, IO counts, and various IO sizes.  Due to charting being disabled, no chart is provided.
--------------------------------------------------

2025-07-27 15:03:54,445 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: e61afd56-6693-448c-8269-cded90544bde) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- After successfully gathering data with Teradata tools, consider if a visualization would enhance the answer.
- Use a chart tool if it provides a clear summary (e.g., bar chart for space usage, pie chart for distributions).
- Do not generate charts for simple data retrievals that are easily readable in a table.
- When you use a chart tool, tell the user in your final answer what the chart represents.

--- **Response Formatting** ---
-   **To execute a tool:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
-   **To execute a prompt:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `prompt_name` and `arguments`.
-   **Clarifying Question:** Only ask if information is truly missing.

        This MUST be called before any other RAG-related tools.

        The following values are hardcoded:
        - query_table = 'user_query'
        - query_embedding_store = 'user_query_embeddings'
        - model_id = 'bge-small-en-v1.5'

        You only need to provide the database locations:
        - query_db: where user queries and query embeddings will be stored
        - model_db: where the embedding model metadata is stored
        - vector_db + vector_table: where PDF chunk embeddings are stored

        Once this configuration is set, all other RAG tools will reuse it automatically.
        
- `rag_storeUserQuery`: Store a user's natural language question as the first step in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow.This tool should always be run **before any embedding or similarity search** steps.It inserts the raw question into a Teradata table specified by `db_name` and `table_name`. If the question starts with the prefix '/rag ', the prefix is automatically stripped before storage. Each question is appended as a new row with a generated ID and timestamp.If the specified table does not exist, it will be created with columns: `id`, `txt`, and `created_ts`.Returns the inserted row ID and cleaned question text.This tool is **only needed once per user question** â€” downstream embedding and vector search tools can then reference this ID or re-use the stored question text.
- `rag_tokenizeQuery`: Tokenizes the latest user-submitted question using the tokenizer specified in the current RAG configuration. This tool must be used *after* calling 'configure_rag' (to initialize the config) and 'store_user_query' (to capture a user question). It selects the most recent row from the query table (e.g., 'pdf_topics_of_interest'), runs it through the ONNX tokenizer, and creates a temporary view '<query_db>.v_topics_tokenized' containing 'id', 'txt', 'input_ids', and 'attention_mask'. This view is used downstream to generate vector embeddings for similarity search.
- `rag_createEmbeddingView`: Generates sentence embeddings for the most recent tokenized user query using the model specified in the RAG configuration. Reads from the view `<db>.v_topics_tokenized` and applies the ONNX model from `<model_db>.embeddings_models`. Creates or replaces the view `<db>.v_topics_embeddings` which includes the original input and a `sentence_embedding` column. This must be run *after* create_tokenized_view and before vector_to_columns().
- `rag_createQueryEmbeddingTable`: Converts the sentence embedding from the view `v_topics_embeddings` into 384 vector columns using `ivsm.vector_to_columns`. Creates or replaces a physical table to store the latest query embeddings for use in similarity search. The table location is defined via `rag_set_config`. This tool must be run *after* `create_embedding_view` and before `semantic_search_chunks`.
- `rag_semanticSearchChunks`: Retrieve top-k most relevant PDF chunks for the user's latest embedded query. This tool is part of the RAG workflow and should be called after the query has been embedded. If the RAG config has not been set, use `rag_set_config` first to define where queries, models, and chunk embeddings are stored. Uses cosine similarity via `TD_VECTORDISTANCE` to compare embeddings. Each result includes similarity score, chunk text, page number, chunk number, and document name.
- `sec_userDbPermissions`: Get permissions for a user.
- `sec_rolePermissions`: Get permissions for a role.
- `sec_userRoles`: Get roles assigned to a user.
- `reconnect_to_database`: Reconnect to the Teradata database if the connection is lost.
- `fs_setFeatureStoreConfig`: Set or update the feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- `fs_getFeatureStoreConfig`: Display the current feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- `fs_isFeatureStorePresent`: Check if a feature store is present in the specified database.
- `fs_featureStoreContent`: Returns a summary of the feature store content. Use this to understand what data is available in the feature store
- `fs_getDataDomains`: List the available data domains. Requires a configured `db_name`  in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- `fs_getFeatures`: List the list of features. Requires a configured `db_name` and  `data_domain` in the feature store config. Use this to explore the features available .
- `fs_getAvailableDatasets`: List the list of available datasets.Requires a configured `db_name` in the feature store config.Use this to explore the datasets that are available .
- `fs_getFeatureDataModel`: Return the schema of the feature store.Requires a feature store in the configured database (`db_name`).
- `fs_getAvailableEntities`: List the available entities for a given data domain. Requires a configured `db_name` and `data_domain` and  `entity` in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- `fs_createDataset`: Create a dataset using selected features and an entity from the feature store. The dataset is created in the specified target database under the given name. Requires a configured feature store and data domain. Registers the dataset in the catalog automatically. Use this when you want to build and register a new dataset for analysis or modeling.
- `get_cust_activeUsers`: Fetch currently active database users
- `get_td_serverInfo`: Get the Teradata software information: demonstrates how to use parameters for prepared statements.
- `get_cube_cube_db_space_metrics`: 
    Tool to query the cube 'table_skew_pct'.
    Get the Teradata database space metrics for tables and databases

    Expected inputs:
        dimensions (str): Comma-separated dimension names to group by. Allowed values:
    - DatabaseName: Name of the database
    - TableName: Name of the table

        measures (str): Comma-separated measure names to aggregate (must match cube definition). Allowed values:

[model]: Understood. I will follow all instructions.
[user]: please outline the system utilization using a chart
[model]: Thought:The user requests a chart outlining system utilization.  There's no single prompt to fulfill this request, so I need to synthesize a plan using available tools.  The `dba_resusageSummary` tool seems appropriate to retrieve the necessary utilization data.  Since charting is disabled, I will only return the data.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
  "arguments": {}
}
```

[user]: Based on the history, what is the next action to complete the user's request? If you have enough information, your response **MUST** start with `FINAL_ANSWER:`. Otherwise, provide the JSON for the next tool call.

The last tool execution returned the following result. Use this to inform your next action:

[model]: FINAL_ANSWER:The following table shows the Teradata system resource usage summary, aggregated by hour of day and day of week.  The metrics include request count, CPU time, IO counts, and various IO sizes.  Due to charting being disabled, no chart is provided.


--- Current User Prompt ---
please outline the system utilization using a chart

2025-07-27 15:03:56,255 - --- RESPONSE ---
Thought:The user again requests a chart outlining system utilization. As before,  `dba_resusageSummary` is the appropriate tool to retrieve the data.  However, charting is still disabled, so I will only return the data.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
  "arguments": {}
}
```
--------------------------------------------------

2025-07-27 15:03:57,028 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: e61afd56-6693-448c-8269-cded90544bde) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- After successfully gathering data with Teradata tools, consider if a visualization would enhance the answer.
- Use a chart tool if it provides a clear summary (e.g., bar chart for space usage, pie chart for distributions).
- Do not generate charts for simple data retrievals that are easily readable in a table.
- When you use a chart tool, tell the user in your final answer what the chart represents.

--- **Response Formatting** ---
-   **To execute a tool:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
-   **To execute a prompt:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `prompt_name` and `arguments`.
-   **Clarifying Question:** Only ask if information is truly missing.

--- Available Tools ---
- `base_readQuery`: Executes a SQL query to read from the database.
- `base_writeQuery`: Executes a SQL query to write to the database.
- `base_tableDDL`: Display table DDL definition.
- `base_databaseList`: List all databases in the Teradata System.
- `base_tableList`: List objects in a database.
- `base_columnDescription`: Show detailed column information about a database table.
- `base_tablePreview`: Get data samples and structure overview from a database table.
- `base_tableAffinity`: Get tables commonly used together by database users, this is helpful to infer relationships between tables.
- `base_tableUsage`: Measure the usage of a table and views by users in a given schema, this is helpful to infer what database objects are most actively used or drive most value.

- `qlty_negativeValues`: Get the column names that having negative values in a table.
- `qlty_distinctCategories`: Get the destinct categories from column in a table.
- `qlty_standardDeviation`: Get the standard deviation from column in a table.
- `qlty_columnSummary`: Get the column summary statistics for a table.
- `qlty_univariateStatistics`: Get the univariate statistics for a table.
- `qlty_rowsWithMissingValues`: Get the rows with missing values in a table.
- `rag_setConfig`: 
        Set the configuration for the current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) session.
        This MUST be called before any other RAG-related tools.

        The following values are hardcoded:
        - query_table = 'user_query'
        - query_embedding_store = 'user_query_embeddings'
        - model_id = 'bge-small-en-v1.5'

        You only need to provide the database locations:
        - query_db: where user queries and query embeddings will be stored
        - model_db: where the embedding model metadata is stored
        - vector_db + vector_table: where PDF chunk embeddings are stored

        Once this configuration is set, all other RAG tools will reuse it automatically.
        
- `rag_storeUserQuery`: Store a user's natural language question as the first step in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow.This tool should always be run **before any embedding or similarity search** steps.It inserts the raw question into a Teradata table specified by `db_name` and `table_name`. If the question starts with the prefix '/rag ', the prefix is automatically stripped before storage. Each question is appended as a new row with a generated ID and timestamp.If the specified table does not exist, it will be created with columns: `id`, `txt`, and `created_ts`.Returns the inserted row ID and cleaned question text.This tool is **only needed once per user question** â€” downstream embedding and vector search tools can then reference this ID or re-use the stored question text.
- `rag_tokenizeQuery`: Tokenizes the latest user-submitted question using the tokenizer specified in the current RAG configuration. This tool must be used *after* calling 'configure_rag' (to initialize the config) and 'store_user_query' (to capture a user question). It selects the most recent row from the query table (e.g., 'pdf_topics_of_interest'), runs it through the ONNX tokenizer, and creates a temporary view '<query_db>.v_topics_tokenized' containing 'id', 'txt', 'input_ids', and 'attention_mask'. This view is used downstream to generate vector embeddings for similarity search.
- `rag_createEmbeddingView`: Generates sentence embeddings for the most recent tokenized user query using the model specified in the RAG configuration. Reads from the view `<db>.v_topics_tokenized` and applies the ONNX model from `<model_db>.embeddings_models`. Creates or replaces the view `<db>.v_topics_embeddings` which includes the original input and a `sentence_embedding` column. This must be run *after* create_tokenized_view and before vector_to_columns().
- `rag_createQueryEmbeddingTable`: Converts the sentence embedding from the view `v_topics_embeddings` into 384 vector columns using `ivsm.vector_to_columns`. Creates or replaces a physical table to store the latest query embeddings for use in similarity search. The table location is defined via `rag_set_config`. This tool must be run *after* `create_embedding_view` and before `semantic_search_chunks`.
- `rag_semanticSearchChunks`: Retrieve top-k most relevant PDF chunks for the user's latest embedded query. This tool is part of the RAG workflow and should be called after the query has been embedded. If the RAG config has not been set, use `rag_set_config` first to define where queries, models, and chunk embeddings are stored. Uses cosine similarity via `TD_VECTORDISTANCE` to compare embeddings. Each result includes similarity score, chunk text, page number, chunk number, and document name.
- `sec_userDbPermissions`: Get permissions for a user.
- `sec_rolePermissions`: Get permissions for a role.
- `sec_userRoles`: Get roles assigned to a user.
- `reconnect_to_database`: Reconnect to the Teradata database if the connection is lost.
- `fs_setFeatureStoreConfig`: Set or update the feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- `fs_getFeatureStoreConfig`: Display the current feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- `fs_isFeatureStorePresent`: Check if a feature store is present in the specified database.
- `fs_featureStoreContent`: Returns a summary of the feature store content. Use this to understand what data is available in the feature store
- `fs_getDataDomains`: List the available data domains. Requires a configured `db_name`  in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- `fs_getFeatures`: List the list of features. Requires a configured `db_name` and  `data_domain` in the feature store config. Use this to explore the features available .
- `fs_getAvailableDatasets`: List the list of available datasets.Requires a configured `db_name` in the feature store config.Use this to explore the datasets that are available .
- `fs_getFeatureDataModel`: Return the schema of the feature store.Requires a feature store in the configured database (`db_name`).
- `fs_getAvailableEntities`: List the available entities for a given data domain. Requires a configured `db_name` and `data_domain` and  `entity` in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- `fs_createDataset`: Create a dataset using selected features and an entity from the feature store. The dataset is created in the specified target database under the given name. Requires a configured feature store and data domain. Registers the dataset in the catalog automatically. Use this when you want to build and register a new dataset for analysis or modeling.
- `get_cust_activeUsers`: Fetch currently active database users
- `get_td_serverInfo`: Get the Teradata software information: demonstrates how to use parameters for prepared statements.
- `get_cube_cube_db_space_metrics`: 
    Tool to query the cube 'table_skew_pct'.
    Get the Teradata database space metrics for tables and databases

[model]: Understood. I will follow all instructions.
[user]: please outline the system utilization using a chart
[model]: Thought:The user requests a chart outlining system utilization.  There's no single prompt to fulfill this request, so I need to synthesize a plan using available tools.  The `dba_resusageSummary` tool seems appropriate to retrieve the necessary utilization data.  Since charting is disabled, I will only return the data.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
  "arguments": {}
}
```

[user]: Based on the history, what is the next action to complete the user's request? If you have enough information, your response **MUST** start with `FINAL_ANSWER:`. Otherwise, provide the JSON for the next tool call.

The last tool execution returned the following result. Use this to inform your next action:

[model]: FINAL_ANSWER:The following table shows the Teradata system resource usage summary, aggregated by hour of day and day of week.  The metrics include request count, CPU time, IO counts, and various IO sizes.  Due to charting being disabled, no chart is provided.

[user]: please outline the system utilization using a chart
[model]: Thought:The user again requests a chart outlining system utilization. As before,  `dba_resusageSummary` is the appropriate tool to retrieve the data.  However, charting is still disabled, so I will only return the data.

```json
