2025-08-23 00:24:51,207 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: dc30d5b5-fbb5-43aa-b8f9-9059699d8e97) ---
--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Generating a strategic meta-plan for the goal: 'how many databases are on the system?'

--- History ---


--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): how many databases are on the system?
- Workflow History (Actions taken so far): []
- Known Entities (Key information discovered so far): {}

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal and Context**: Carefully read the "GOAL" and review the "CONTEXT" section to understand the user's full intent and what has already been established.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Contextual Awareness)**: You **MUST** use the `Known Entities` and `Workflow History` to resolve ambiguities in the user's request. For example, if `Known Entities` shows that 'callcenter' is a known table, you **MUST** create a plan to analyze the table, not a database with the same name.
3.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
4.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase. This goal will guide a separate, tactical LLM.
    -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of tool names that are permitted to be used during this phase. You **MUST** select the most appropriate and specific tools from the full "Capabilities" list provided in the main system prompt to achieve the phase's goal.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
5.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
6.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process with a final reporting requirement, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase that handles both the synthesis of the final report AND its formatting. The `relevant_tools` for this final phase **MUST** be `["CoreLLMTask"]`.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call (e.g., "list all databases", "what is the system utilization?"), your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate tool. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Types)**: You are generating a plan of executable **tools**. The `relevant_tools` list **MUST ONLY** contain names of capabilities that are explicitly marked as `(tool)` in the system's "Capabilities" list. You **MUST NOT** include the name of any capability marked as `(prompt)`.
10. **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.

--- EXAMPLE (Complex Goal with Context) ---
- **Context**: `known_entities` shows `{ "database_name": "sales" }`.
- **Goal**: "summarize the customers table"
- **Correct Plan**:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the DDL for the table 'customers' in database 'sales' using the `base_tableDDL` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Synthesize a final report by describing the 'customers' table in a business context.",
    "relevant_tools": ["CoreLLMTask"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

--- History ---


--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are a tactical assistant executing a single phase of a larger plan. Your task is to decide the single best next action to take to achieve the current phase's goal, strictly adhering to the provided tool constraints.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
Retrieve the list of all databases on the Teradata system and count how many databases are on the system using the `base_databaseList` tool.

--- CONSTRAINTS ---
- Permitted Tools for this Phase (You MUST use the exact argument names provided):

- Tool: `base_databaseList`
  - Description: Lists all databases in the Teradata System.

- Previous Attempt (if any): None

--- WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY ---
- Actions Taken So Far: []
- Data Collected So Far: {}


--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection & Arguments)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool. Furthermore, you **MUST** use the exact argument names as they are defined in the tool details above. You **MUST NOT** invent, hallucinate, or use any arguments that are not explicitly listed in the definitions.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If you are in a looping phase (indicated by the presence of a "LOOP CONTEXT" section), you **MUST** focus your action on the single item provided in `current_loop_item`. You **MUST** use the information within that item to formulate the arguments for your tool call.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

--- ADDITIONAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS ---
You MUST format your entire response using standard markdown. Use a level-2 heading (e.g., '## Key Observations') for sections. Use bullet points (e.g., '- Item 1') for lists of observations. Use bold text (e.g., '**Important Term**') for emphasis.

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULE:** Your entire response MUST be a prose-based, narrative summary using standard markdown. Do NOT use special key-value formats like `***Key:*** Value`. Start with a direct, one-paragraph answer, followed by a `## Key Observations` section with bullet points if applicable.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.

2025-08-23 00:24:55,655 - --- RESPONSE ---
There are 22 databases on the system.

## Key Observations

- The system contains a total of 50 database entries, but these include both user schemas and actual databases.
- Filtering out the user-type entries leaves 22 entities classified as databases.
- Among these databases, several are system-related (e.g., TD_SYSXML, SYSJDBC, SYSBAR), some are service-oriented (e.g., TDaaS_DB, TDaaS_BAR), and others appear designated for specific applications or demos (e.g., DEMO_Customer360, DEMO_DigitalEvents).
- The databases serve a range of purposes including router management, analytics, backup and restore, monitoring, and spatial data management.
- This diversity reflects a mature environment supporting operational, analytical, and service functions across different business domains.

--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Generating a strategic meta-plan for the goal: 'what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?'

--- History ---


--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?
- Workflow History (Actions taken so far): []
- Known Entities (Key information discovered so far): {}

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal and Context**: Carefully read the "GOAL" and review the "CONTEXT" section to understand the user's full intent and what has already been established.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Contextual Awareness)**: You **MUST** use the `Known Entities` and `Workflow History` to resolve ambiguities in the user's request. For example, if `Known Entities` shows that 'callcenter' is a known table, you **MUST** create a plan to analyze the table, not a database with the same name.
3.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
4.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase. This goal will guide a separate, tactical LLM.
    -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of tool names that are permitted to be used during this phase. You **MUST** select the most appropriate and specific tools from the full "Capabilities" list provided in the main system prompt to achieve the phase's goal.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
5.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
6.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process with a final reporting requirement, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase that handles both the synthesis of the final report AND its formatting. The `relevant_tools` for this final phase **MUST** be `["CoreLLMTask"]`.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call (e.g., "list all databases", "what is the system utilization?"), your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate tool. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Types)**: You are generating a plan of executable **tools**. The `relevant_tools` list **MUST ONLY** contain names of capabilities that are explicitly marked as `(tool)` in the system's "Capabilities" list. You **MUST NOT** include the name of any capability marked as `(prompt)`.
10. **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.

--- EXAMPLE (Complex Goal with Context) ---
- **Context**: `known_entities` shows `{ "database_name": "sales" }`.
- **Goal**: "summarize the customers table"
- **Correct Plan**:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the DDL for the table 'customers' in database 'sales' using the `base_tableDDL` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Synthesize a final report by describing the 'customers' table in a business context.",
    "relevant_tools": ["CoreLLMTask"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

Deciding next tactical action for phase: List all tables in the database 'DEMO_Customer360_db' to understand what tables are contained in this database.

--- History ---


--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are a tactical assistant executing a single phase of a larger plan. Your task is to decide the single best next action to take to achieve the current phase's goal, strictly adhering to the provided tool constraints.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?

--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
List all tables in the database 'DEMO_Customer360_db' to understand what tables are contained in this database.

--- CONSTRAINTS ---
- Permitted Tools for this Phase (You MUST use the exact argument names provided):

- Tool: `base_tableList`
  - Description: Lists all tables in a database.
  - Arguments:
    - `database_name` (string, optional): No description.

- Previous Attempt (if any): None

--- WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY ---
- Actions Taken So Far: []
- Data Collected So Far: {}


--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection & Arguments)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool. Furthermore, you **MUST** use the exact argument names as they are defined in the tool details above. You **MUST NOT** invent, hallucinate, or use any arguments that are not explicitly listed in the definitions.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If you are in a looping phase (indicated by the presence of a "LOOP CONTEXT" section), you **MUST** focus your action on the single item provided in `current_loop_item`. You **MUST** use the information within that item to formulate the arguments for your tool call.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.

Your most important task is to directly answer the user's original question: 'what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?'.
You MUST begin your response with the direct answer. Do not repeat the user's question or use conversational intros like 'Here is...'. After providing the direct answer, you may then proceed with a more general summary or analysis of the data.

--- TASK ---
You are an expert data analyst. Your task is to analyze the provided data and extract only the most important conclusions and key insights. Do not describe the raw data or explain how you performed the analysis. Focus on providing a concise, specific, and business-friendly summary of the findings.

--- RELEVANT DATA (Selected from Previous Phases) ---
{
  "result_of_phase_1": [

      ]
    }
  ]
}

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

--- ADDITIONAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS ---
You MUST format your entire response using standard markdown. Use a level-2 heading (e.g., '## Key Observations') for sections. Use bullet points (e.g., '- Item 1') for lists of observations. Use bold text (e.g., '**Important Term**') for emphasis.

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULE:** Your entire response MUST be a prose-based, narrative summary using standard markdown. Do NOT use special key-value formats like `***Key:*** Value`. Start with a direct, one-paragraph answer, followed by a `## Key Observations` section with bullet points if applicable.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.

2025-08-23 00:25:10,407 - --- RESPONSE ---
DEMO_Customer360_db contains two primary tables: Equipment and CallCenter.

## Key Observations

- The **Equipment** table likely holds data related to assets or machinery relevant to customer interactions or service delivery. This can support detailed analytics on equipment usage, maintenance, or inventory.
- The **CallCenter** table presumably captures information on customer service calls, enabling insights into call volumes, issue types, customer satisfaction metrics, and agent performance.
- Together, these tables provide a foundational dataset for a 360-degree customer view by linking service usage and customer support interactions.
- The database’s focus appears to be on operational and service-related dimensions rather than direct customer demographic or transactional data, which suggests its role in supporting service management and customer interaction analysis.
