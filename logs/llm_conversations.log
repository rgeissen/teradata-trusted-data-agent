You are a helpful assistant that organizes lists of technical tools for a **Teradata database system** into logical categories for a user interface. Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object. The keys should be the category names, and the values should be an array of tool names belonging to that category.

--- Tool List ---
- base_readQuery: Executes a SQL query to read from the database.
- base_writeQuery: Executes a SQL query to write to the database.
- base_tableDDL: Display table DDL definition.

- base_tableAffinity: Get tables commonly used together by database users, this is helpful to infer relationships between tables.
- base_tableUsage: Measure the usage of a table and views by users in a given schema, this is helpful to infer what database objects are most actively used or drive most value.

- dba_tableSqlList: Get a list of SQL run against a table in the last number of days 
- dba_tableSpace: Get table space used for a table if table name is provided or get table space for all tables in a database if a database name is provided.
- dba_databaseSpace: Get database space if database name is provided, otherwise get all databases space allocations.
- dba_databaseVersion: Get Teradata database version information.
- dba_resusageSummary: Get the Teradata system usage summary metrics by weekday and hour for each workload type and query complexity bucket.
- dba_resusageUserSummary: Get the Teradata system usage summary metrics by user on a specified date, or day of week and hour of day.
- dba_flowControl: Get the Teradata flow control metrics.
- dba_featureUsage: Get the user feature usage metrics.
- dba_userDelay: Get the Teradata user delay metrics.
- dba_tableUsageImpact: Measure the usage of a table and views by users, this is helpful to understand what user and tables are driving most resource usage at any point in time.
- dba_sessionInfo: Get the Teradata session information for user.
- qlty_missingValues: Get the column names that having missing values in a table.
- qlty_negativeValues: Get the column names that having negative values in a table.
- qlty_distinctCategories: Get the destinct categories from column in a table.
- qlty_standardDeviation: Get the standard deviation from column in a table.
- qlty_columnSummary: Get the column summary statistics for a table.
- qlty_univariateStatistics: Get the univariate statistics for a table.
- qlty_rowsWithMissingValues: Get the rows with missing values in a table.
- rag_setConfig: 
        Set the configuration for the current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) session.
        This MUST be called before any other RAG-related tools.

        The following values are hardcoded:
        - query_table = 'user_query'
        - query_embedding_store = 'user_query_embeddings'
        - model_id = 'bge-small-en-v1.5'

        You only need to provide the database locations:
        - query_db: where user queries and query embeddings will be stored
        - model_db: where the embedding model metadata is stored
        - vector_db + vector_table: where PDF chunk embeddings are stored

        Once this configuration is set, all other RAG tools will reuse it automatically.
        
- rag_storeUserQuery: Store a user's natural language question as the first step in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow.This tool should always be run **before any embedding or similarity search** steps.It inserts the raw question into a Teradata table specified by `db_name` and `table_name`. If the question starts with the prefix '/rag ', the prefix is automatically stripped before storage. Each question is appended as a new row with a generated ID and timestamp.If the specified table does not exist, it will be created with columns: `id`, `txt`, and `created_ts`.Returns the inserted row ID and cleaned question text.This tool is **only needed once per user question** â€” downstream embedding and vector search tools can then reference this ID or re-use the stored question text.
- rag_tokenizeQuery: Tokenizes the latest user-submitted question using the tokenizer specified in the current RAG configuration. This tool must be used *after* calling 'configure_rag' (to initialize the config) and 'store_user_query' (to capture a user question). It selects the most recent row from the query table (e.g., 'pdf_topics_of_interest'), runs it through the ONNX tokenizer, and creates a temporary view '<query_db>.v_topics_tokenized' containing 'id', 'txt', 'input_ids', and 'attention_mask'. This view is used downstream to generate vector embeddings for similarity search.
- rag_createEmbeddingView: Generates sentence embeddings for the most recent tokenized user query using the model specified in the RAG configuration. Reads from the view `<db>.v_topics_tokenized` and applies the ONNX model from `<model_db>.embeddings_models`. Creates or replaces the view `<db>.v_topics_embeddings` which includes the original input and a `sentence_embedding` column. This must be run *after* create_tokenized_view and before vector_to_columns().
- rag_createQueryEmbeddingTable: Converts the sentence embedding from the view `v_topics_embeddings` into 384 vector columns using `ivsm.vector_to_columns`. Creates or replaces a physical table to store the latest query embeddings for use in similarity search. The table location is defined via `rag_set_config`. This tool must be run *after* `create_embedding_view` and before `semantic_search_chunks`.
- rag_semanticSearchChunks: Retrieve top-k most relevant PDF chunks for the user's latest embedded query. This tool is part of the RAG workflow and should be called after the query has been embedded. If the RAG config has not been set, use `rag_set_config` first to define where queries, models, and chunk embeddings are stored. Uses cosine similarity via `TD_VECTORDISTANCE` to compare embeddings. Each result includes similarity score, chunk text, page number, chunk number, and document name.
- sec_userDbPermissions: Get permissions for a user.
- sec_rolePermissions: Get permissions for a role.
- sec_userRoles: Get roles assigned to a user.
- reconnect_to_database: Reconnect to the Teradata database if the connection is lost.
- fs_setFeatureStoreConfig: Set or update the feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- fs_getFeatureStoreConfig: Display the current feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- fs_isFeatureStorePresent: Check if a feature store is present in the specified database.
- fs_featureStoreContent: Returns a summary of the feature store content. Use this to understand what data is available in the feature store
- fs_getDataDomains: List the available data domains. Requires a configured `db_name`  in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- fs_getFeatures: List the list of features. Requires a configured `db_name` and  `data_domain` in the feature store config. Use this to explore the features available .
- fs_getAvailableDatasets: List the list of available datasets.Requires a configured `db_name` in the feature store config.Use this to explore the datasets that are available .
- fs_getFeatureDataModel: Return the schema of the feature store.Requires a feature store in the configured database (`db_name`).
- fs_getAvailableEntities: List the available entities for a given data domain. Requires a configured `db_name` and `data_domain` and  `entity` in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- fs_createDataset: Create a dataset using selected features and an entity from the feature store. The dataset is created in the specified target database under the given name. Requires a configured feature store and data domain. Registers the dataset in the catalog automatically. Use this when you want to build and register a new dataset for analysis or modeling.
- get_cust_activeUsers: Fetch currently active database users
- get_td_serverInfo: Get the Teradata software information: demonstrates how to use parameters for prepared statements.
- get_cube_cube_db_space_metrics: 
    Tool to query the cube 'table_skew_pct'.
    Get the Teradata database space metrics for tables and databases

    Expected inputs:
        dimensions (str): Comma-separated dimension names to group by. Allowed values:
    - DatabaseName: Name of the database
    - TableName: Name of the table

        measures (str): Comma-separated measure names to aggregate (must match cube definition). Allowed values:
    - current_perm: Object perm space in bytes
    - peak_perm: Object peak perm space in bytes
    - table_skew_pct: Object skew percentage

    Returns:
        Query result as a formatted response.
