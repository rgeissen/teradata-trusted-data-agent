--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Analyzing user query to determine the first action.

--- History ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1.  The user's query is about a **table**.
    2.  My critical rule is to prioritize specificity. I must choose a table-level tool.
    3.  The `qlty_databaseQuality` prompt is for databases, not specific tables, so it's incorrect.
    4.  The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1.  The user's query is about a **database**. It's a broad request ("describe").
    2.  A prompt is better for broad tasks.
    3.  The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt takes a `database_name` and is the correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

**Example 3:**
- **User Query:** "what is the system utilization?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1.  The user is asking for a specific metric: "system utilization". This is a direct request for data.
    2.  My critical rule states I must prioritize a `tool_name` for direct actions.
    3.  The `dba_systemVoice` prompt is for adopting a persona, not for fetching specific metrics. It is the incorrect choice.
    4.  The `dba_resusageSummary` tool in the `Performance` category is designed to get system usage summary metrics. This is the correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary", "arguments": {}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:
how many databases are on the system?
[model]: ```json
{"tool_name": "base_databaseList", "arguments": {}}
```

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1.  The user's query is about a **table**.
    2.  My critical rule is to prioritize specificity. I must choose a table-level tool.
    3.  The `qlty_databaseQuality` prompt is for databases, not specific tables, so it's incorrect.
    4.  The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1.  The user's query is about a **database**. It's a broad request ("describe").
    2.  A prompt is better for broad tasks.
    3.  The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt takes a `database_name` and is the correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

**Example 3:**
- **User Query:** "what is the system utilization?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1.  The user is asking for a specific metric: "system utilization". This is a direct request for data.
    2.  My critical rule states I must prioritize a `tool_name` for direct actions.
    3.  The `dba_systemVoice` prompt is for adopting a persona, not for fetching specific metrics. It is the incorrect choice.
    4.  The `dba_resusageSummary` tool in the `Performance` category is designed to get system usage summary metrics. This is the correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary", "arguments": {}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

--- Your Decision Process ---
1.  **Analyze the situation:** Your primary goal is to gather all necessary data to comprehensively answer the user's original question. You may need to call several tools in sequence.
2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If you need more information to answer the question, call another tool or prompt by providing the appropriate JSON block.
    -   If you are confident that you have now gathered **all** the necessary data from this and any previous tool calls, your response **MUST** be only the exact string `SYSTEM_ACTION_COMPLETE`. This will signal the final report writer to begin.
    -   If the last tool call resulted in an error, you MUST attempt to recover by calling a corrected tool.


2025-08-18 06:59:13,876 - --- RESPONSE ---
FINAL_ANSWER: There are 48 databases on the system.
