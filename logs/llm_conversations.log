- qlty_rowsWithMissingValues: Get the rows with missing values in a table.
- rag_setConfig: 
        Set the configuration for the current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) session.
        This MUST be called before any other RAG-related tools.

        The following values are hardcoded:
        - query_table = 'user_query'
        - query_embedding_store = 'user_query_embeddings'
        - model_id = 'bge-small-en-v1.5'

        You only need to provide the database locations:
        - query_db: where user queries and query embeddings will be stored
        - model_db: where the embedding model metadata is stored
        - vector_db + vector_table: where PDF chunk embeddings are stored

        Once this configuration is set, all other RAG tools will reuse it automatically.
        
- rag_storeUserQuery: Store a user's natural language question as the first step in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow.This tool should always be run **before any embedding or similarity search** steps.It inserts the raw question into a Teradata table specified by `db_name` and `table_name`. If the question starts with the prefix '/rag ', the prefix is automatically stripped before storage. Each question is appended as a new row with a generated ID and timestamp.If the specified table does not exist, it will be created with columns: `id`, `txt`, and `created_ts`.Returns the inserted row ID and cleaned question text.This tool is **only needed once per user question** â€” downstream embedding and vector search tools can then reference this ID or re-use the stored question text.
- rag_tokenizeQuery: Tokenizes the latest user-submitted question using the tokenizer specified in the current RAG configuration. This tool must be used *after* calling 'configure_rag' (to initialize the config) and 'store_user_query' (to capture a user question). It selects the most recent row from the query table (e.g., 'pdf_topics_of_interest'), runs it through the ONNX tokenizer, and creates a temporary view '<query_db>.v_topics_tokenized' containing 'id', 'txt', 'input_ids', and 'attention_mask'. This view is used downstream to generate vector embeddings for similarity search.
- rag_createEmbeddingView: Generates sentence embeddings for the most recent tokenized user query using the model specified in the RAG configuration. Reads from the view `<db>.v_topics_tokenized` and applies the ONNX model from `<model_db>.embeddings_models`. Creates or replaces the view `<db>.v_topics_embeddings` which includes the original input and a `sentence_embedding` column. This must be run *after* create_tokenized_view and before vector_to_columns().
- rag_createQueryEmbeddingTable: Converts the sentence embedding from the view `v_topics_embeddings` into 384 vector columns using `ivsm.vector_to_columns`. Creates or replaces a physical table to store the latest query embeddings for use in similarity search. The table location is defined via `rag_set_config`. This tool must be run *after* `create_embedding_view` and before `semantic_search_chunks`.
- rag_semanticSearchChunks: Retrieve top-k most relevant PDF chunks for the user's latest embedded query. This tool is part of the RAG workflow and should be called after the query has been embedded. If the RAG config has not been set, use `rag_set_config` first to define where queries, models, and chunk embeddings are stored. Uses cosine similarity via `TD_VECTORDISTANCE` to compare embeddings. Each result includes similarity score, chunk text, page number, chunk number, and document name.
- sec_userDbPermissions: Get permissions for a user.
- sec_rolePermissions: Get permissions for a role.
- sec_userRoles: Get roles assigned to a user.
- reconnect_to_database: Reconnect to the Teradata database if the connection is lost.
- fs_setFeatureStoreConfig: Set or update the feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- fs_getFeatureStoreConfig: Display the current feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- fs_isFeatureStorePresent: Check if a feature store is present in the specified database.
- fs_featureStoreContent: Returns a summary of the feature store content. Use this to understand what data is available in the feature store

- fs_getFeatureDataModel: Return the schema of the feature store.Requires a feature store in the configured database (`db_name`).
- fs_getAvailableEntities: List the available entities for a given data domain. Requires a configured `db_name` and `data_domain` and  `entity` in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- fs_createDataset: Create a dataset using selected features and an entity from the feature store. The dataset is created in the specified target database under the given name. Requires a configured feature store and data domain. Registers the dataset in the catalog automatically. Use this when you want to build and register a new dataset for analysis or modeling.
- get_cust_activeUsers: Fetch currently active database users
- get_td_serverInfo: Get the Teradata software information: demonstrates how to use parameters for prepared statements.

2025-07-26 18:48:59,382 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 51b79580-b772-4c35-8b20-cabc4053a013) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names. For example, if a tool is defined to accept a parameter named `sql`, you MUST use `"sql": "..."` in your JSON. Using a guess like `"query": "..."` or `"sql_query": "..."` will fail.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`). Do **NOT** pass the database name as a separate `db_name` argument to `base_readQuery`.

--- **Response Formatting** ---
-   **To execute a tool:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
-   **To execute a prompt:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `prompt_name` and `arguments`.
-   **Clarifying Question:** Only ask if information is truly missing.

- `rag_tokenizeQuery`: Tokenizes the latest user-submitted question using the tokenizer specified in the current RAG configuration. This tool must be used *after* calling 'configure_rag' (to initialize the config) and 'store_user_query' (to capture a user question). It selects the most recent row from the query table (e.g., 'pdf_topics_of_interest'), runs it through the ONNX tokenizer, and creates a temporary view '<query_db>.v_topics_tokenized' containing 'id', 'txt', 'input_ids', and 'attention_mask'. This view is used downstream to generate vector embeddings for similarity search.
- `rag_createEmbeddingView`: Generates sentence embeddings for the most recent tokenized user query using the model specified in the RAG configuration. Reads from the view `<db>.v_topics_tokenized` and applies the ONNX model from `<model_db>.embeddings_models`. Creates or replaces the view `<db>.v_topics_embeddings` which includes the original input and a `sentence_embedding` column. This must be run *after* create_tokenized_view and before vector_to_columns().
- `rag_createQueryEmbeddingTable`: Converts the sentence embedding from the view `v_topics_embeddings` into 384 vector columns using `ivsm.vector_to_columns`. Creates or replaces a physical table to store the latest query embeddings for use in similarity search. The table location is defined via `rag_set_config`. This tool must be run *after* `create_embedding_view` and before `semantic_search_chunks`.
- `rag_semanticSearchChunks`: Retrieve top-k most relevant PDF chunks for the user's latest embedded query. This tool is part of the RAG workflow and should be called after the query has been embedded. If the RAG config has not been set, use `rag_set_config` first to define where queries, models, and chunk embeddings are stored. Uses cosine similarity via `TD_VECTORDISTANCE` to compare embeddings. Each result includes similarity score, chunk text, page number, chunk number, and document name.
- `sec_userDbPermissions`: Get permissions for a user.
- `sec_rolePermissions`: Get permissions for a role.
- `sec_userRoles`: Get roles assigned to a user.
- `reconnect_to_database`: Reconnect to the Teradata database if the connection is lost.
- `fs_setFeatureStoreConfig`: Set or update the feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- `fs_getFeatureStoreConfig`: Display the current feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- `fs_isFeatureStorePresent`: Check if a feature store is present in the specified database.
- `fs_featureStoreContent`: Returns a summary of the feature store content. Use this to understand what data is available in the feature store

- `fs_getFeatures`: List the list of features. Requires a configured `db_name` and  `data_domain` in the feature store config. Use this to explore the features available .
- `fs_getAvailableDatasets`: List the list of available datasets.Requires a configured `db_name` in the feature store config.Use this to explore the datasets that are available .
- `fs_getFeatureDataModel`: Return the schema of the feature store.Requires a feature store in the configured database (`db_name`).
- `fs_getAvailableEntities`: List the available entities for a given data domain. Requires a configured `db_name` and `data_domain` and  `entity` in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- `fs_createDataset`: Create a dataset using selected features and an entity from the feature store. The dataset is created in the specified target database under the given name. Requires a configured feature store and data domain. Registers the dataset in the catalog automatically. Use this when you want to build and register a new dataset for analysis or modeling.
- `get_cust_activeUsers`: Fetch currently active database users
- `get_td_serverInfo`: Get the Teradata software information: demonstrates how to use parameters for prepared statements.
- `get_cube_cube_db_space_metrics`: 
    Tool to query the cube 'table_skew_pct'.
    Get the Teradata database space metrics for tables and databases

    Expected inputs:

--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names. For example, if a tool is defined to accept a parameter named `sql`, you MUST use `"sql": "..."` in your JSON. Using a guess like `"query": "..."` or `"sql_query": "..."` will fail.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`). Do **NOT** pass the database name as a separate `db_name` argument to `base_readQuery`.

--- **Response Formatting** ---
-   **To execute a tool:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
-   **To execute a prompt:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `prompt_name` and `arguments`.
-   **Clarifying Question:** Only ask if information is truly missing.

--------------------------------------------------

2025-07-26 18:49:41,582 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 51b79580-b772-4c35-8b20-cabc4053a013) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names. For example, if a tool is defined to accept a parameter named `sql`, you MUST use `"sql": "..."` in your JSON. Using a guess like `"query": "..."` or `"sql_query": "..."` will fail.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`). Do **NOT** pass the database name as a separate `db_name` argument to `base_readQuery`.

--- **Response Formatting** ---
-   **To execute a tool:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
-   **To execute a prompt:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `prompt_name` and `arguments`.
-   **Clarifying Question:** Only ask if information is truly missing.

--- Available Tools by Scope ---

## Database Level Tools
- `base_readQuery`: Executes a SQL query to read from the database.
- `base_writeQuery`: Executes a SQL query to write to the database.
- `base_databaseList`: List all databases in the Teradata System.
- `base_tableList`: List objects in a database.
- `base_tableUsage`: Measure the usage of a table and views by users in a given schema, this is helpful to infer what database objects are most actively used or drive most value.
- `dba_userSqlList`: Get a list of SQL run by a user in the last number of days if a user name is provided, otherwise get list of all SQL in the last number of days.
- `dba_databaseSpace`: Get database space if database name is provided, otherwise get all databases space allocations.
- `dba_databaseVersion`: Get Teradata database version information.
- `dba_resusageSummary`: Get the Teradata system usage summary metrics by weekday and hour for each workload type and query complexity bucket.
- `dba_resusageUserSummary`: Get the Teradata system usage summary metrics by user on a specified date, or day of week and hour of day.
- `dba_flowControl`: Get the Teradata flow control metrics.
- `dba_featureUsage`: Get the user feature usage metrics.
- `dba_userDelay`: Get the Teradata user delay metrics.
- `dba_tableUsageImpact`: Measure the usage of a table and views by users, this is helpful to understand what user and tables are driving most resource usage at any point in time.
- `dba_sessionInfo`: Get the Teradata session information for user.
- `rag_setConfig`: 
        Set the configuration for the current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) session.
        This MUST be called before any other RAG-related tools.

        The following values are hardcoded:
        - query_table = 'user_query'
        - query_embedding_store = 'user_query_embeddings'
        - model_id = 'bge-small-en-v1.5'

        You only need to provide the database locations:
        - query_db: where user queries and query embeddings will be stored
        - model_db: where the embedding model metadata is stored
        - vector_db + vector_table: where PDF chunk embeddings are stored

        Once this configuration is set, all other RAG tools will reuse it automatically.
        
- `rag_tokenizeQuery`: Tokenizes the latest user-submitted question using the tokenizer specified in the current RAG configuration. This tool must be used *after* calling 'configure_rag' (to initialize the config) and 'store_user_query' (to capture a user question). It selects the most recent row from the query table (e.g., 'pdf_topics_of_interest'), runs it through the ONNX tokenizer, and creates a temporary view '<query_db>.v_topics_tokenized' containing 'id', 'txt', 'input_ids', and 'attention_mask'. This view is used downstream to generate vector embeddings for similarity search.
- `rag_createEmbeddingView`: Generates sentence embeddings for the most recent tokenized user query using the model specified in the RAG configuration. Reads from the view `<db>.v_topics_tokenized` and applies the ONNX model from `<model_db>.embeddings_models`. Creates or replaces the view `<db>.v_topics_embeddings` which includes the original input and a `sentence_embedding` column. This must be run *after* create_tokenized_view and before vector_to_columns().
- `rag_createQueryEmbeddingTable`: Converts the sentence embedding from the view `v_topics_embeddings` into 384 vector columns using `ivsm.vector_to_columns`. Creates or replaces a physical table to store the latest query embeddings for use in similarity search. The table location is defined via `rag_set_config`. This tool must be run *after* `create_embedding_view` and before `semantic_search_chunks`.
- `rag_semanticSearchChunks`: Retrieve top-k most relevant PDF chunks for the user's latest embedded query. This tool is part of the RAG workflow and should be called after the query has been embedded. If the RAG config has not been set, use `rag_set_config` first to define where queries, models, and chunk embeddings are stored. Uses cosine similarity via `TD_VECTORDISTANCE` to compare embeddings. Each result includes similarity score, chunk text, page number, chunk number, and document name.
- `sec_userDbPermissions`: Get permissions for a user.
- `sec_rolePermissions`: Get permissions for a role.
- `sec_userRoles`: Get roles assigned to a user.
- `reconnect_to_database`: Reconnect to the Teradata database if the connection is lost.

--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names. For example, if a tool is defined to accept a parameter named `sql`, you MUST use `"sql": "..."` in your JSON. Using a guess like `"query": "..."` or `"sql_query": "..."` will fail.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`). Do **NOT** pass the database name as a separate `db_name` argument to `base_readQuery`.

--- **Response Formatting** ---
-   **To execute a tool:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
-   **To execute a prompt:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `prompt_name` and `arguments`.
-   **Clarifying Question:** Only ask if information is truly missing.

--- Available Tools by Scope ---

## Database Level Tools
- `base_readQuery`: Executes a SQL query to read from the database.
- `base_writeQuery`: Executes a SQL query to write to the database.
- `base_databaseList`: List all databases in the Teradata System.
- `base_tableList`: List objects in a database.
- `base_tableUsage`: Measure the usage of a table and views by users in a given schema, this is helpful to infer what database objects are most actively used or drive most value.
- `dba_userSqlList`: Get a list of SQL run by a user in the last number of days if a user name is provided, otherwise get list of all SQL in the last number of days.
- `dba_databaseSpace`: Get database space if database name is provided, otherwise get all databases space allocations.
- `dba_databaseVersion`: Get Teradata database version information.
- `dba_resusageSummary`: Get the Teradata system usage summary metrics by weekday and hour for each workload type and query complexity bucket.
- `dba_resusageUserSummary`: Get the Teradata system usage summary metrics by user on a specified date, or day of week and hour of day.
- `dba_flowControl`: Get the Teradata flow control metrics.
- `dba_featureUsage`: Get the user feature usage metrics.
- `dba_userDelay`: Get the Teradata user delay metrics.
- `dba_tableUsageImpact`: Measure the usage of a table and views by users, this is helpful to understand what user and tables are driving most resource usage at any point in time.
- `dba_sessionInfo`: Get the Teradata session information for user.
- `rag_setConfig`: 
        Set the configuration for the current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) session.
        This MUST be called before any other RAG-related tools.

        The following values are hardcoded:
        - query_table = 'user_query'
        - query_embedding_store = 'user_query_embeddings'
        - model_id = 'bge-small-en-v1.5'

        You only need to provide the database locations:
        - query_db: where user queries and query embeddings will be stored
        - model_db: where the embedding model metadata is stored
        - vector_db + vector_table: where PDF chunk embeddings are stored

        Once this configuration is set, all other RAG tools will reuse it automatically.
        
- `rag_tokenizeQuery`: Tokenizes the latest user-submitted question using the tokenizer specified in the current RAG configuration. This tool must be used *after* calling 'configure_rag' (to initialize the config) and 'store_user_query' (to capture a user question). It selects the most recent row from the query table (e.g., 'pdf_topics_of_interest'), runs it through the ONNX tokenizer, and creates a temporary view '<query_db>.v_topics_tokenized' containing 'id', 'txt', 'input_ids', and 'attention_mask'. This view is used downstream to generate vector embeddings for similarity search.
- `rag_createEmbeddingView`: Generates sentence embeddings for the most recent tokenized user query using the model specified in the RAG configuration. Reads from the view `<db>.v_topics_tokenized` and applies the ONNX model from `<model_db>.embeddings_models`. Creates or replaces the view `<db>.v_topics_embeddings` which includes the original input and a `sentence_embedding` column. This must be run *after* create_tokenized_view and before vector_to_columns().
- `rag_createQueryEmbeddingTable`: Converts the sentence embedding from the view `v_topics_embeddings` into 384 vector columns using `ivsm.vector_to_columns`. Creates or replaces a physical table to store the latest query embeddings for use in similarity search. The table location is defined via `rag_set_config`. This tool must be run *after* `create_embedding_view` and before `semantic_search_chunks`.
- `rag_semanticSearchChunks`: Retrieve top-k most relevant PDF chunks for the user's latest embedded query. This tool is part of the RAG workflow and should be called after the query has been embedded. If the RAG config has not been set, use `rag_set_config` first to define where queries, models, and chunk embeddings are stored. Uses cosine similarity via `TD_VECTORDISTANCE` to compare embeddings. Each result includes similarity score, chunk text, page number, chunk number, and document name.
- `sec_userDbPermissions`: Get permissions for a user.
- `sec_rolePermissions`: Get permissions for a role.
- `sec_userRoles`: Get roles assigned to a user.
- `reconnect_to_database`: Reconnect to the Teradata database if the connection is lost.
- `fs_setFeatureStoreConfig`: Set or update the feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- `fs_getFeatureStoreConfig`: Display the current feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- `fs_isFeatureStorePresent`: Check if a feature store is present in the specified database.
- `fs_featureStoreContent`: Returns a summary of the feature store content. Use this to understand what data is available in the feature store
- `fs_getDataDomains`: List the available data domains. Requires a configured `db_name`  in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- `fs_getFeatures`: List the list of features. Requires a configured `db_name` and  `data_domain` in the feature store config. Use this to explore the features available .
- `fs_getAvailableDatasets`: List the list of available datasets.Requires a configured `db_name` in the feature store config.Use this to explore the datasets that are available .
- `fs_getFeatureDataModel`: Return the schema of the feature store.Requires a feature store in the configured database (`db_name`).
- `fs_getAvailableEntities`: List the available entities for a given data domain. Requires a configured `db_name` and `data_domain` and  `entity` in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- `fs_createDataset`: Create a dataset using selected features and an entity from the feature store. The dataset is created in the specified target database under the given name. Requires a configured feature store and data domain. Registers the dataset in the catalog automatically. Use this when you want to build and register a new dataset for analysis or modeling.
- `get_cust_activeUsers`: Fetch currently active database users
- `get_td_serverInfo`: Get the Teradata software information: demonstrates how to use parameters for prepared statements.
- `get_cube_cube_db_space_metrics`: 
    Tool to query the cube 'table_skew_pct'.
    Get the Teradata database space metrics for tables and databases

    Expected inputs:
        dimensions (str): Comma-separated dimension names to group by. Allowed values:
    - DatabaseName: Name of the database

- `qlty_columnSummary`: Get the column summary statistics for a table.
- `rag_storeUserQuery`: Store a user's natural language question as the first step in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow.This tool should always be run **before any embedding or similarity search** steps.It inserts the raw question into a Teradata table specified by `db_name` and `table_name`. If the question starts with the prefix '/rag ', the prefix is automatically stripped before storage. Each question is appended as a new row with a generated ID and timestamp.If the specified table does not exist, it will be created with columns: `id`, `txt`, and `created_ts`.Returns the inserted row ID and cleaned question text.This tool is **only needed once per user question** â€” downstream embedding and vector search tools can then reference this ID or re-use the stored question text.

        The following values are hardcoded:
        - query_table = 'user_query'
        - query_embedding_store = 'user_query_embeddings'
        - model_id = 'bge-small-en-v1.5'

        You only need to provide the database locations:

        Once this configuration is set, all other RAG tools will reuse it automatically.
        
- `rag_tokenizeQuery`: Tokenizes the latest user-submitted question using the tokenizer specified in the current RAG configuration. This tool must be used *after* calling 'configure_rag' (to initialize the config) and 'store_user_query' (to capture a user question). It selects the most recent row from the query table (e.g., 'pdf_topics_of_interest'), runs it through the ONNX tokenizer, and creates a temporary view '<query_db>.v_topics_tokenized' containing 'id', 'txt', 'input_ids', and 'attention_mask'. This view is used downstream to generate vector embeddings for similarity search.
- `rag_createEmbeddingView`: Generates sentence embeddings for the most recent tokenized user query using the model specified in the RAG configuration. Reads from the view `<db>.v_topics_tokenized` and applies the ONNX model from `<model_db>.embeddings_models`.

2025-07-26 18:49:53,958 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 51b79580-b772-4c35-8b20-cabc4053a013) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names. For example, if a tool is defined to accept a parameter named `sql`, you MUST use `"sql": "..."` in your JSON. Using a guess like `"query": "..."` or `"sql_query": "..."` will fail.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`). Do **NOT** pass the database name as a separate `db_name` argument to `base_readQuery`.

--- **Response Formatting** ---
-   **To execute a tool:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
-   **To execute a prompt:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `prompt_name` and `arguments`.
-   **Clarifying Question:** Only ask if information is truly missing.

2025-07-26 18:49:55,766 - --- RESPONSE ---
Thought:The `qlty_columnSummary` results show that the `Equipment` table has no missing values (NullCount = 0 for all columns) and no blank values (BlankCount = 0 for all columns).  All numeric columns have only positive values (except for `CUST_ID` and `EQUIP_LTV`, which have zeros but are valid). This suggests good data quality in terms of completeness and validity. To further enhance the assessment, let's check for other potential quality issues using `qlty_missingValues` and `qlty_negativeValues`.  However, based on the summary, the initial assessment is positive.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "qlty_missingValues",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "Equipment"
  }

2025-07-26 18:49:56,076 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 51b79580-b772-4c35-8b20-cabc4053a013) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names. For example, if a tool is defined to accept a parameter named `sql`, you MUST use `"sql": "..."` in your JSON. Using a guess like `"query": "..."` or `"sql_query": "..."` will fail.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`). Do **NOT** pass the database name as a separate `db_name` argument to `base_readQuery`.

--- **Response Formatting** ---
-   **To execute a tool:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
-   **To execute a prompt:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `prompt_name` and `arguments`.
-   **Clarifying Question:** Only ask if information is truly missing.

--- Available Tools by Scope ---

## Database Level Tools
- `base_readQuery`: Executes a SQL query to read from the database.
- `base_writeQuery`: Executes a SQL query to write to the database.
- `base_databaseList`: List all databases in the Teradata System.

- `dba_flowControl`: Get the Teradata flow control metrics.
- `dba_featureUsage`: Get the user feature usage metrics.
- `dba_userDelay`: Get the Teradata user delay metrics.
- `dba_tableUsageImpact`: Measure the usage of a table and views by users, this is helpful to understand what user and tables are driving most resource usage at any point in time.
- `dba_sessionInfo`: Get the Teradata session information for user.
- `rag_setConfig`: 
        Set the configuration for the current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) session.
        This MUST be called before any other RAG-related tools.

        The following values are hardcoded:
        - query_table = 'user_query'
        - query_embedding_store = 'user_query_embeddings'
        - model_id = 'bge-small-en-v1.5'

        You only need to provide the database locations:
        - query_db: where user queries and query embeddings will be stored
        - model_db: where the embedding model metadata is stored
        - vector_db + vector_table: where PDF chunk embeddings are stored

        Once this configuration is set, all other RAG tools will reuse it automatically.
        
- `rag_tokenizeQuery`: Tokenizes the latest user-submitted question using the tokenizer specified in the current RAG configuration. This tool must be used *after* calling 'configure_rag' (to initialize the config) and 'store_user_query' (to capture a user question). It selects the most recent row from the query table (e.g., 'pdf_topics_of_interest'), runs it through the ONNX tokenizer, and creates a temporary view '<query_db>.v_topics_tokenized' containing 'id', 'txt', 'input_ids', and 'attention_mask'. This view is used downstream to generate vector embeddings for similarity search.
- `rag_createEmbeddingView`: Generates sentence embeddings for the most recent tokenized user query using the model specified in the RAG configuration. Reads from the view `<db>.v_topics_tokenized` and applies the ONNX model from `<model_db>.embeddings_models`. Creates or replaces the view `<db>.v_topics_embeddings` which includes the original input and a `sentence_embedding` column. This must be run *after* create_tokenized_view and before vector_to_columns().
- `rag_createQueryEmbeddingTable`: Converts the sentence embedding from the view `v_topics_embeddings` into 384 vector columns using `ivsm.vector_to_columns`. Creates or replaces a physical table to store the latest query embeddings for use in similarity search. The table location is defined via `rag_set_config`. This tool must be run *after* `create_embedding_view` and before `semantic_search_chunks`.
- `rag_semanticSearchChunks`: Retrieve top-k most relevant PDF chunks for the user's latest embedded query. This tool is part of the RAG workflow and should be called after the query has been embedded. If the RAG config has not been set, use `rag_set_config` first to define where queries, models, and chunk embeddings are stored. Uses cosine similarity via `TD_VECTORDISTANCE` to compare embeddings. Each result includes similarity score, chunk text, page number, chunk number, and document name.
- `sec_userDbPermissions`: Get permissions for a user.
- `sec_rolePermissions`: Get permissions for a role.

- `fs_getFeatureDataModel`: Return the schema of the feature store.Requires a feature store in the configured database (`db_name`).
- `fs_getAvailableEntities`: List the available entities for a given data domain. Requires a configured `db_name` and `data_domain` and  `entity` in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- `fs_createDataset`: Create a dataset using selected features and an entity from the feature store. The dataset is created in the specified target database under the given name. Requires a configured feature store and data domain. Registers the dataset in the catalog automatically. Use this when you want to build and register a new dataset for analysis or modeling.
- `get_cust_activeUsers`: Fetch currently active database users
- `get_td_serverInfo`: Get the Teradata software information: demonstrates how to use parameters for prepared statements.
- `get_cube_cube_db_space_metrics`: 
    Tool to query the cube 'table_skew_pct'.

[model]: FINAL_ANSWER: The Teradata system contains the following databases: TD_SYSXML, DEMO_Customer360_db, gs_tables_db, TD_SYSGPL, SYSJDBC, TD_SYSFNLIB, TD_ANALYTICS_DB, SYSLIB, SQLJ, TDaaS_DB, dbcmngr, TDStats, SYSBAR, TDQCD, GLOBAL_FUNCTIONS, system, TDBCMgmt, SYSUDTLIB, TD_SERVER_DB, SYSSPATIAL, DEMO_Customer360, DEMO_DigitalEvents, DEMO_DigitalEvents_db, SYSUIF, and modelops.  There are also several users listed, which are not databases.

[user]: what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?
[model]: Thought:The user is asking for a list of tables within the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. The `base_tableList` tool is appropriate for this request.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"
  }

[model]: FINAL_ANSWER: The DEMO_Customer360_db database contains two tables: Equipment and CallCenter.

[user]: what is the quality of Equipment?
[model]: Thought:The user is asking about the quality of the `Equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database.  This requires a multi-step approach to assess data quality. I will start by using `qlty_columnSummary` to get an overview of the column statistics.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "Equipment"
  }

[model]: Thought:The `qlty_columnSummary` results show that the `Equipment` table has no missing values (NullCount = 0 for all columns) and no blank values (BlankCount = 0 for all columns).  All numeric columns have only positive values (except for `CUST_ID` and `EQUIP_LTV`, which have zeros but are valid). This suggests good data quality in terms of completeness and validity. To further enhance the assessment, let's check for other potential quality issues using `qlty_missingValues` and `qlty_negativeValues`.  However, based on the summary, the initial assessment is positive.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "qlty_missingValues",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "Equipment"
  }
}
```

2025-07-26 18:49:57,594 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 51b79580-b772-4c35-8b20-cabc4053a013) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names. For example, if a tool is defined to accept a parameter named `sql`, you MUST use `"sql": "..."` in your JSON. Using a guess like `"query": "..."` or `"sql_query": "..."` will fail.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`). Do **NOT** pass the database name as a separate `db_name` argument to `base_readQuery`.

--- **Response Formatting** ---
-   **To execute a tool:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
-   **To execute a prompt:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `prompt_name` and `arguments`.
-   **Clarifying Question:** Only ask if information is truly missing.

--- Available Tools by Scope ---

## Database Level Tools
- `base_readQuery`: Executes a SQL query to read from the database.
- `base_writeQuery`: Executes a SQL query to write to the database.
- `base_databaseList`: List all databases in the Teradata System.
- `base_tableList`: List objects in a database.
- `base_tableUsage`: Measure the usage of a table and views by users in a given schema, this is helpful to infer what database objects are most actively used or drive most value.
- `dba_userSqlList`: Get a list of SQL run by a user in the last number of days if a user name is provided, otherwise get list of all SQL in the last number of days.
- `dba_databaseSpace`: Get database space if database name is provided, otherwise get all databases space allocations.

- `dba_flowControl`: Get the Teradata flow control metrics.
- `dba_featureUsage`: Get the user feature usage metrics.
- `dba_userDelay`: Get the Teradata user delay metrics.
- `dba_tableUsageImpact`: Measure the usage of a table and views by users, this is helpful to understand what user and tables are driving most resource usage at any point in time.
- `dba_sessionInfo`: Get the Teradata session information for user.
- `rag_setConfig`: 
        Set the configuration for the current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) session.
        This MUST be called before any other RAG-related tools.

        The following values are hardcoded:
        - query_table = 'user_query'
        - query_embedding_store = 'user_query_embeddings'
        - model_id = 'bge-small-en-v1.5'

        You only need to provide the database locations:
        - query_db: where user queries and query embeddings will be stored
        - model_db: where the embedding model metadata is stored
        - vector_db + vector_table: where PDF chunk embeddings are stored

        Once this configuration is set, all other RAG tools will reuse it automatically.
        
- `rag_tokenizeQuery`: Tokenizes the latest user-submitted question using the tokenizer specified in the current RAG configuration. This tool must be used *after* calling 'configure_rag' (to initialize the config) and 'store_user_query' (to capture a user question). It selects the most recent row from the query table (e.g., 'pdf_topics_of_interest'), runs it through the ONNX tokenizer, and creates a temporary view '<query_db>.v_topics_tokenized' containing 'id', 'txt', 'input_ids', and 'attention_mask'. This view is used downstream to generate vector embeddings for similarity search.
- `rag_createEmbeddingView`: Generates sentence embeddings for the most recent tokenized user query using the model specified in the RAG configuration. Reads from the view `<db>.v_topics_tokenized` and applies the ONNX model from `<model_db>.embeddings_models`. Creates or replaces the view `<db>.v_topics_embeddings` which includes the original input and a `sentence_embedding` column. This must be run *after* create_tokenized_view and before vector_to_columns().
- `rag_createQueryEmbeddingTable`: Converts the sentence embedding from the view `v_topics_embeddings` into 384 vector columns using `ivsm.vector_to_columns`. Creates or replaces a physical table to store the latest query embeddings for use in similarity search. The table location is defined via `rag_set_config`. This tool must be run *after* `create_embedding_view` and before `semantic_search_chunks`.
- `rag_semanticSearchChunks`: Retrieve top-k most relevant PDF chunks for the user's latest embedded query. This tool is part of the RAG workflow and should be called after the query has been embedded. If the RAG config has not been set, use `rag_set_config` first to define where queries, models, and chunk embeddings are stored. Uses cosine similarity via `TD_VECTORDISTANCE` to compare embeddings. Each result includes similarity score, chunk text, page number, chunk number, and document name.
- `sec_userDbPermissions`: Get permissions for a user.
- `sec_rolePermissions`: Get permissions for a role.
- `sec_userRoles`: Get roles assigned to a user.
- `reconnect_to_database`: Reconnect to the Teradata database if the connection is lost.

- `fs_getFeatureStoreConfig`: Display the current feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- `fs_isFeatureStorePresent`: Check if a feature store is present in the specified database.
- `fs_featureStoreContent`: Returns a summary of the feature store content. Use this to understand what data is available in the feature store
- `fs_getDataDomains`: List the available data domains. Requires a configured `db_name`  in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- `fs_getFeatures`: List the list of features. Requires a configured `db_name` and  `data_domain` in the feature store config. Use this to explore the features available .
- `fs_getAvailableDatasets`: List the list of available datasets.Requires a configured `db_name` in the feature store config.Use this to explore the datasets that are available .
- `fs_getFeatureDataModel`: Return the schema of the feature store.Requires a feature store in the configured database (`db_name`).
- `fs_getAvailableEntities`: List the available entities for a given data domain. Requires a configured `db_name` and `data_domain` and  `entity` in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- `fs_createDataset`: Create a dataset using selected features and an entity from the feature store. The dataset is created in the specified target database under the given name. Requires a configured feature store and data domain. Registers the dataset in the catalog automatically. Use this when you want to build and register a new dataset for analysis or modeling.
- `get_cust_activeUsers`: Fetch currently active database users
- `get_td_serverInfo`: Get the Teradata software information: demonstrates how to use parameters for prepared statements.
- `get_cube_cube_db_space_metrics`: 
    Tool to query the cube 'table_skew_pct'.
    Get the Teradata database space metrics for tables and databases

    Expected inputs:

- `qlty_columnSummary`: Get the column summary statistics for a table.
- `rag_storeUserQuery`: Store a user's natural language question as the first step in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow.This tool should always be run **before any embedding or similarity search** steps.It inserts the raw question into a Teradata table specified by `db_name` and `table_name`. If the question starts with the prefix '/rag ', the prefix is automatically stripped before storage. Each question is appended as a new row with a generated ID and timestamp.If the specified table does not exist, it will be created with columns: `id`, `txt`, and `created_ts`.Returns the inserted row ID and cleaned question text.This tool is **only needed once per user question** â€” downstream embedding and vector search tools can then reference this ID or re-use the stored question text.

[model]: FINAL_ANSWER: The Teradata system contains the following databases: TD_SYSXML, DEMO_Customer360_db, gs_tables_db, TD_SYSGPL, SYSJDBC, TD_SYSFNLIB, TD_ANALYTICS_DB, SYSLIB, SQLJ, TDaaS_DB, dbcmngr, TDStats, SYSBAR, TDQCD, GLOBAL_FUNCTIONS, system, TDBCMgmt, SYSUDTLIB, TD_SERVER_DB, SYSSPATIAL, DEMO_Customer360, DEMO_DigitalEvents, DEMO_DigitalEvents_db, SYSUIF, and modelops.  There are also several users listed, which are not databases.

[user]: what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?
[model]: Thought:The user is asking for a list of tables within the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. The `base_tableList` tool is appropriate for this request.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"
  }

[model]: FINAL_ANSWER: The DEMO_Customer360_db database contains two tables: Equipment and CallCenter.

[user]: what is the quality of Equipment?
[model]: Thought:The user is asking about the quality of the `Equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database.  This requires a multi-step approach to assess data quality. I will start by using `qlty_columnSummary` to get an overview of the column statistics.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "Equipment"
  }

[model]: Thought:The `qlty_columnSummary` results show that the `Equipment` table has no missing values (NullCount = 0 for all columns) and no blank values (BlankCount = 0 for all columns).  All numeric columns have only positive values (except for `CUST_ID` and `EQUIP_LTV`, which have zeros but are valid). This suggests good data quality in terms of completeness and validity. To further enhance the assessment, let's check for other potential quality issues using `qlty_missingValues` and `qlty_negativeValues`.  However, based on the summary, the initial assessment is positive.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "qlty_missingValues",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "Equipment"
  }
}

[model]: Thought:The `qlty_missingValues` tool confirms that there are no missing values in any column of the `Equipment` table.  Let's proceed with checking for negative values.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "qlty_negativeValues",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "Equipment"

FINAL_ANSWER: Based on the analysis from `qlty_columnSummary`, `qlty_missingValues`, and `qlty_negativeValues`, the Equipment table exhibits high data quality. There are no missing values, no blank values, and no negative values in the numeric columns.  The data appears complete and valid.
--------------------------------------------------

2025-07-26 18:50:46,698 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 51b79580-b772-4c35-8b20-cabc4053a013) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names. For example, if a tool is defined to accept a parameter named `sql`, you MUST use `"sql": "..."` in your JSON. Using a guess like `"query": "..."` or `"sql_query": "..."` will fail.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`). Do **NOT** pass the database name as a separate `db_name` argument to `base_readQuery`.

--- **Response Formatting** ---
-   **To execute a tool:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
-   **To execute a prompt:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `prompt_name` and `arguments`.
-   **Clarifying Question:** Only ask if information is truly missing.

--- Available Tools by Scope ---

## Database Level Tools
- `base_readQuery`: Executes a SQL query to read from the database.
- `base_writeQuery`: Executes a SQL query to write to the database.
- `base_databaseList`: List all databases in the Teradata System.
- `base_tableList`: List objects in a database.
- `base_tableUsage`: Measure the usage of a table and views by users in a given schema, this is helpful to infer what database objects are most actively used or drive most value.
- `dba_userSqlList`: Get a list of SQL run by a user in the last number of days if a user name is provided, otherwise get list of all SQL in the last number of days.
- `dba_databaseSpace`: Get database space if database name is provided, otherwise get all databases space allocations.

- `dba_flowControl`: Get the Teradata flow control metrics.
- `dba_featureUsage`: Get the user feature usage metrics.
- `dba_userDelay`: Get the Teradata user delay metrics.
- `dba_tableUsageImpact`: Measure the usage of a table and views by users, this is helpful to understand what user and tables are driving most resource usage at any point in time.
- `dba_sessionInfo`: Get the Teradata session information for user.
- `rag_setConfig`: 
        Set the configuration for the current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) session.
        This MUST be called before any other RAG-related tools.

        The following values are hardcoded:
        - query_table = 'user_query'
        - query_embedding_store = 'user_query_embeddings'
        - model_id = 'bge-small-en-v1.5'

        You only need to provide the database locations:
        - query_db: where user queries and query embeddings will be stored
        - model_db: where the embedding model metadata is stored
        - vector_db + vector_table: where PDF chunk embeddings are stored

        Once this configuration is set, all other RAG tools will reuse it automatically.
        
- `rag_tokenizeQuery`: Tokenizes the latest user-submitted question using the tokenizer specified in the current RAG configuration. This tool must be used *after* calling 'configure_rag' (to initialize the config) and 'store_user_query' (to capture a user question). It selects the most recent row from the query table (e.g., 'pdf_topics_of_interest'), runs it through the ONNX tokenizer, and creates a temporary view '<query_db>.v_topics_tokenized' containing 'id', 'txt', 'input_ids', and 'attention_mask'. This view is used downstream to generate vector embeddings for similarity search.
- `rag_createEmbeddingView`: Generates sentence embeddings for the most recent tokenized user query using the model specified in the RAG configuration. Reads from the view `<db>.v_topics_tokenized` and applies the ONNX model from `<model_db>.embeddings_models`. Creates or replaces the view `<db>.v_topics_embeddings` which includes the original input and a `sentence_embedding` column. This must be run *after* create_tokenized_view and before vector_to_columns().
- `rag_createQueryEmbeddingTable`: Converts the sentence embedding from the view `v_topics_embeddings` into 384 vector columns using `ivsm.vector_to_columns`. Creates or replaces a physical table to store the latest query embeddings for use in similarity search. The table location is defined via `rag_set_config`. This tool must be run *after* `create_embedding_view` and before `semantic_search_chunks`.
- `rag_semanticSearchChunks`: Retrieve top-k most relevant PDF chunks for the user's latest embedded query. This tool is part of the RAG workflow and should be called after the query has been embedded. If the RAG config has not been set, use `rag_set_config` first to define where queries, models, and chunk embeddings are stored. Uses cosine similarity via `TD_VECTORDISTANCE` to compare embeddings. Each result includes similarity score, chunk text, page number, chunk number, and document name.
- `sec_userDbPermissions`: Get permissions for a user.
- `sec_rolePermissions`: Get permissions for a role.
- `sec_userRoles`: Get roles assigned to a user.

- `fs_getFeatureStoreConfig`: Display the current feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- `fs_isFeatureStorePresent`: Check if a feature store is present in the specified database.
- `fs_featureStoreContent`: Returns a summary of the feature store content. Use this to understand what data is available in the feature store
- `fs_getDataDomains`: List the available data domains. Requires a configured `db_name`  in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.

- `fs_getFeatureDataModel`: Return the schema of the feature store.Requires a feature store in the configured database (`db_name`).
- `fs_getAvailableEntities`: List the available entities for a given data domain. Requires a configured `db_name` and `data_domain` and  `entity` in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- `fs_createDataset`: Create a dataset using selected features and an entity from the feature store. The dataset is created in the specified target database under the given name. Requires a configured feature store and data domain. Registers the dataset in the catalog automatically. Use this when you want to build and register a new dataset for analysis or modeling.
- `get_cust_activeUsers`: Fetch currently active database users
- `get_td_serverInfo`: Get the Teradata software information: demonstrates how to use parameters for prepared statements.
- `get_cube_cube_db_space_metrics`: 
    Tool to query the cube 'table_skew_pct'.
    Get the Teradata database space metrics for tables and databases

    Expected inputs:
        dimensions (str): Comma-separated dimension names to group by. Allowed values:
    - DatabaseName: Name of the database

- `qlty_columnSummary`: Get the column summary statistics for a table.
- `rag_storeUserQuery`: Store a user's natural language question as the first step in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow.This tool should always be run **before any embedding or similarity search** steps.It inserts the raw question into a Teradata table specified by `db_name` and `table_name`. If the question starts with the prefix '/rag ', the prefix is automatically stripped before storage. Each question is appended as a new row with a generated ID and timestamp.If the specified table does not exist, it will be created with columns: `id`, `txt`, and `created_ts`.Returns the inserted row ID and cleaned question text.This tool is **only needed once per user question** â€” downstream embedding and vector search tools can then reference this ID or re-use the stored question text.

[model]: FINAL_ANSWER: The Teradata system contains the following databases: TD_SYSXML, DEMO_Customer360_db, gs_tables_db, TD_SYSGPL, SYSJDBC, TD_SYSFNLIB, TD_ANALYTICS_DB, SYSLIB, SQLJ, TDaaS_DB, dbcmngr, TDStats, SYSBAR, TDQCD, GLOBAL_FUNCTIONS, system, TDBCMgmt, SYSUDTLIB, TD_SERVER_DB, SYSSPATIAL, DEMO_Customer360, DEMO_DigitalEvents, DEMO_DigitalEvents_db, SYSUIF, and modelops.  There are also several users listed, which are not databases.

[user]: what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?
[model]: Thought:The user is asking for a list of tables within the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. The `base_tableList` tool is appropriate for this request.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"
  }
}
```

[model]: FINAL_ANSWER: The DEMO_Customer360_db database contains two tables: Equipment and CallCenter.

[user]: what is the quality of Equipment?
[model]: Thought:The user is asking about the quality of the `Equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database.  This requires a multi-step approach to assess data quality. I will start by using `qlty_columnSummary` to get an overview of the column statistics.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "Equipment"
  }
}
```

{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "tool_output": {"status": "success", "metadata": {"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "table_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db.Equipment"}, "results": [{"ColumnName": "GENDER", "Datatype": "VARCHAR(1) CHARACTER SET LATIN", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "0", "ZeroCount": "None", "PositiveCount": "None", "NegativeCount": "None", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "ADDRESS", "Datatype": "VARCHAR(25) CHARACTER SET LATIN", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "0", "ZeroCount": "None", "PositiveCount": "None", "NegativeCount": "None", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "CUST_ID", "Datatype": "SMALLINT", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "None", "ZeroCount": "0", "PositiveCount": "100", "NegativeCount": "0", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "FIRSTNAME", "Datatype": "VARCHAR(11) CHARACTER SET LATIN", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "0", "ZeroCount": "None", "PositiveCount": "None", "NegativeCount": "None", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "ZIP", "Datatype": "INTEGER", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "None", "ZeroCount": "0", "PositiveCount": "100", "NegativeCount": "0", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "CITY", "Datatype": "VARCHAR(16) CHARACTER SET LATIN", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "0", "ZeroCount": "None", "PositiveCount": "None", "NegativeCount": "None", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "LASTNAME", "Datatype": "VARCHAR(9) CHARACTER SET LATIN", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "0", "ZeroCount": "None", "PositiveCount": "None", "NegativeCount": "None", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "STATE", "Datatype": "VARCHAR(2) CHARACTER SET LATIN", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "0", "ZeroCount": "None", "PositiveCount": "None", "NegativeCount": "None", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "EQUIP_LTV", "Datatype": "SMALLINT", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "None", "ZeroCount": "0", "PositiveCount": "100", "NegativeCount": "0", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}]}}
[model]: Thought:The `qlty_columnSummary` results show that the `Equipment` table has no missing values (NullCount = 0 for all columns) and no blank values (BlankCount = 0 for all columns).  All numeric columns have only positive values (except for `CUST_ID` and `EQUIP_LTV`, which have zeros but are valid). This suggests good data quality in terms of completeness and validity. To further enhance the assessment, let's check for other potential quality issues using `qlty_missingValues` and `qlty_negativeValues`.  However, based on the summary, the initial assessment is positive.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "qlty_missingValues",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "Equipment"
  }
}

[model]: Thought:The `qlty_missingValues` tool confirms that there are no missing values in any column of the `Equipment` table.  Let's proceed with checking for negative values.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "qlty_negativeValues",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "Equipment"
  }

[model]: FINAL_ANSWER: Based on the analysis from `qlty_columnSummary`, `qlty_missingValues`, and `qlty_negativeValues`, the Equipment table exhibits high data quality. There are no missing values, no blank values, and no negative values in the numeric columns.  The data appears complete and valid.


--- Current User Prompt ---
what is the business definition of equipment?

2025-07-26 18:50:47,958 - --- RESPONSE ---
Thought:The user requests a business definition of the `Equipment` table.  The `base_tableBusinessDesc` prompt is best suited for this.

```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "Equipment"
  }

2025-07-26 18:50:48,014 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 51b79580-b772-4c35-8b20-cabc4053a013) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names. For example, if a tool is defined to accept a parameter named `sql`, you MUST use `"sql": "..."` in your JSON. Using a guess like `"query": "..."` or `"sql_query": "..."` will fail.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`). Do **NOT** pass the database name as a separate `db_name` argument to `base_readQuery`.

--- **Response Formatting** ---
-   **To execute a tool:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
-   **To execute a prompt:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `prompt_name` and `arguments`.
-   **Clarifying Question:** Only ask if information is truly missing.

--- Available Tools by Scope ---

## Database Level Tools

- `dba_flowControl`: Get the Teradata flow control metrics.
- `dba_featureUsage`: Get the user feature usage metrics.
- `dba_userDelay`: Get the Teradata user delay metrics.
- `dba_tableUsageImpact`: Measure the usage of a table and views by users, this is helpful to understand what user and tables are driving most resource usage at any point in time.
- `dba_sessionInfo`: Get the Teradata session information for user.
- `rag_setConfig`: 
        Set the configuration for the current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) session.
        This MUST be called before any other RAG-related tools.

        The following values are hardcoded:
        - query_table = 'user_query'
        - query_embedding_store = 'user_query_embeddings'
        - model_id = 'bge-small-en-v1.5'

        You only need to provide the database locations:
        - query_db: where user queries and query embeddings will be stored
        - model_db: where the embedding model metadata is stored
        - vector_db + vector_table: where PDF chunk embeddings are stored

        Once this configuration is set, all other RAG tools will reuse it automatically.
        
- `rag_tokenizeQuery`: Tokenizes the latest user-submitted question using the tokenizer specified in the current RAG configuration. This tool must be used *after* calling 'configure_rag' (to initialize the config) and 'store_user_query' (to capture a user question). It selects the most recent row from the query table (e.g., 'pdf_topics_of_interest'), runs it through the ONNX tokenizer, and creates a temporary view '<query_db>.v_topics_tokenized' containing 'id', 'txt', 'input_ids', and 'attention_mask'. This view is used downstream to generate vector embeddings for similarity search.
- `rag_createEmbeddingView`: Generates sentence embeddings for the most recent tokenized user query using the model specified in the RAG configuration. Reads from the view `<db>.v_topics_tokenized` and applies the ONNX model from `<model_db>.embeddings_models`. Creates or replaces the view `<db>.v_topics_embeddings` which includes the original input and a `sentence_embedding` column. This must be run *after* create_tokenized_view and before vector_to_columns().
- `rag_createQueryEmbeddingTable`: Converts the sentence embedding from the view `v_topics_embeddings` into 384 vector columns using `ivsm.vector_to_columns`. Creates or replaces a physical table to store the latest query embeddings for use in similarity search. The table location is defined via `rag_set_config`. This tool must be run *after* `create_embedding_view` and before `semantic_search_chunks`.
- `rag_semanticSearchChunks`: Retrieve top-k most relevant PDF chunks for the user's latest embedded query. This tool is part of the RAG workflow and should be called after the query has been embedded. If the RAG config has not been set, use `rag_set_config` first to define where queries, models, and chunk embeddings are stored. Uses cosine similarity via `TD_VECTORDISTANCE` to compare embeddings. Each result includes similarity score, chunk text, page number, chunk number, and document name.
- `sec_userDbPermissions`: Get permissions for a user.
- `sec_rolePermissions`: Get permissions for a role.
- `sec_userRoles`: Get roles assigned to a user.

- `fs_getFeatureDataModel`: Return the schema of the feature store.Requires a feature store in the configured database (`db_name`).
- `fs_getAvailableEntities`: List the available entities for a given data domain. Requires a configured `db_name` and `data_domain` and  `entity` in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- `fs_createDataset`: Create a dataset using selected features and an entity from the feature store. The dataset is created in the specified target database under the given name. Requires a configured feature store and data domain. Registers the dataset in the catalog automatically. Use this when you want to build and register a new dataset for analysis or modeling.
- `get_cust_activeUsers`: Fetch currently active database users
- `get_td_serverInfo`: Get the Teradata software information: demonstrates how to use parameters for prepared statements.
- `get_cube_cube_db_space_metrics`: 
    Tool to query the cube 'table_skew_pct'.
    Get the Teradata database space metrics for tables and databases

    Expected inputs:

[model]: FINAL_ANSWER: The Teradata system contains the following databases: TD_SYSXML, DEMO_Customer360_db, gs_tables_db, TD_SYSGPL, SYSJDBC, TD_SYSFNLIB, TD_ANALYTICS_DB, SYSLIB, SQLJ, TDaaS_DB, dbcmngr, TDStats, SYSBAR, TDQCD, GLOBAL_FUNCTIONS, system, TDBCMgmt, SYSUDTLIB, TD_SERVER_DB, SYSSPATIAL, DEMO_Customer360, DEMO_DigitalEvents, DEMO_DigitalEvents_db, SYSUIF, and modelops.  There are also several users listed, which are not databases.

[user]: what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?
[model]: Thought:The user is asking for a list of tables within the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. The `base_tableList` tool is appropriate for this request.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"
  }
}
```

[user]: Based on the history, what is the next action to complete the user's request? If you have enough information, your response **MUST** start with `FINAL_ANSWER:`. Otherwise, provide the JSON for the next tool call.

The last tool execution returned the following result. Use this to inform your next action:

{"tool_name": "base_tableList", "tool_output": {"status": "success", "metadata": {"tool_name": "base_tableList", "database": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_count": 2}, "results": [{"TableName": "Equipment"}, {"TableName": "CallCenter"}]}}
[model]: FINAL_ANSWER: The DEMO_Customer360_db database contains two tables: Equipment and CallCenter.

[user]: what is the quality of Equipment?
[model]: Thought:The user is asking about the quality of the `Equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database.  This requires a multi-step approach to assess data quality. I will start by using `qlty_columnSummary` to get an overview of the column statistics.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "Equipment"
  }
}
```

{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "tool_output": {"status": "success", "metadata": {"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "table_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db.Equipment"}, "results": [{"ColumnName": "GENDER", "Datatype": "VARCHAR(1) CHARACTER SET LATIN", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "0", "ZeroCount": "None", "PositiveCount": "None", "NegativeCount": "None", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "ADDRESS", "Datatype": "VARCHAR(25) CHARACTER SET LATIN", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "0", "ZeroCount": "None", "PositiveCount": "None", "NegativeCount": "None", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "CUST_ID", "Datatype": "SMALLINT", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "None", "ZeroCount": "0", "PositiveCount": "100", "NegativeCount": "0", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "FIRSTNAME", "Datatype": "VARCHAR(11) CHARACTER SET LATIN", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "0", "ZeroCount": "None", "PositiveCount": "None", "NegativeCount": "None", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "ZIP", "Datatype": "INTEGER", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "None", "ZeroCount": "0", "PositiveCount": "100", "NegativeCount": "0", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "CITY", "Datatype": "VARCHAR(16) CHARACTER SET LATIN", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "0", "ZeroCount": "None", "PositiveCount": "None", "NegativeCount": "None", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "LASTNAME", "Datatype": "VARCHAR(9) CHARACTER SET LATIN", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "0", "ZeroCount": "None", "PositiveCount": "None", "NegativeCount": "None", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "STATE", "Datatype": "VARCHAR(2) CHARACTER SET LATIN", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "0", "ZeroCount": "None", "PositiveCount": "None", "NegativeCount": "None", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "EQUIP_LTV", "Datatype": "SMALLINT", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "None", "ZeroCount": "0", "PositiveCount": "100", "NegativeCount": "0", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}]}}
[model]: Thought:The `qlty_columnSummary` results show that the `Equipment` table has no missing values (NullCount = 0 for all columns) and no blank values (BlankCount = 0 for all columns).  All numeric columns have only positive values (except for `CUST_ID` and `EQUIP_LTV`, which have zeros but are valid). This suggests good data quality in terms of completeness and validity. To further enhance the assessment, let's check for other potential quality issues using `qlty_missingValues` and `qlty_negativeValues`.  However, based on the summary, the initial assessment is positive.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "qlty_missingValues",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "Equipment"
  }
}
```

[model]: Thought:The `qlty_missingValues` tool confirms that there are no missing values in any column of the `Equipment` table.  Let's proceed with checking for negative values.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "qlty_negativeValues",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "Equipment"
  }

[model]: FINAL_ANSWER: Based on the analysis from `qlty_columnSummary`, `qlty_missingValues`, and `qlty_negativeValues`, the Equipment table exhibits high data quality. There are no missing values, no blank values, and no negative values in the numeric columns.  The data appears complete and valid.

[user]: what is the business definition of equipment?
[model]: Thought:The user requests a business definition of the `Equipment` table.  The `base_tableBusinessDesc` prompt is best suited for this.

```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "Equipment"
  }

--- CURRENT STATE ---
- The last action was the execution of the tool `None`.
- The result of this tool call is now in the conversation history.

2025-07-26 18:50:49,407 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 51b79580-b772-4c35-8b20-cabc4053a013) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names. For example, if a tool is defined to accept a parameter named `sql`, you MUST use `"sql": "..."` in your JSON. Using a guess like `"query": "..."` or `"sql_query": "..."` will fail.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`). Do **NOT** pass the database name as a separate `db_name` argument to `base_readQuery`.

--- **Response Formatting** ---
-   **To execute a tool:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
-   **To execute a prompt:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `prompt_name` and `arguments`.
-   **Clarifying Question:** Only ask if information is truly missing.

--- Available Tools by Scope ---

## Database Level Tools
- `base_readQuery`: Executes a SQL query to read from the database.
- `base_writeQuery`: Executes a SQL query to write to the database.
- `base_databaseList`: List all databases in the Teradata System.
- `base_tableList`: List objects in a database.
- `base_tableUsage`: Measure the usage of a table and views by users in a given schema, this is helpful to infer what database objects are most actively used or drive most value.
- `dba_userSqlList`: Get a list of SQL run by a user in the last number of days if a user name is provided, otherwise get list of all SQL in the last number of days.
- `dba_databaseSpace`: Get database space if database name is provided, otherwise get all databases space allocations.
- `dba_databaseVersion`: Get Teradata database version information.
- `dba_resusageSummary`: Get the Teradata system usage summary metrics by weekday and hour for each workload type and query complexity bucket.
- `dba_resusageUserSummary`: Get the Teradata system usage summary metrics by user on a specified date, or day of week and hour of day.
- `dba_flowControl`: Get the Teradata flow control metrics.
- `dba_featureUsage`: Get the user feature usage metrics.
- `dba_userDelay`: Get the Teradata user delay metrics.
- `dba_tableUsageImpact`: Measure the usage of a table and views by users, this is helpful to understand what user and tables are driving most resource usage at any point in time.
- `dba_sessionInfo`: Get the Teradata session information for user.
- `rag_setConfig`: 
        Set the configuration for the current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) session.
        This MUST be called before any other RAG-related tools.

        The following values are hardcoded:
        - query_table = 'user_query'
        - query_embedding_store = 'user_query_embeddings'
        - model_id = 'bge-small-en-v1.5'

        You only need to provide the database locations:
        - query_db: where user queries and query embeddings will be stored
        - model_db: where the embedding model metadata is stored
        - vector_db + vector_table: where PDF chunk embeddings are stored

        Once this configuration is set, all other RAG tools will reuse it automatically.
        
- `rag_tokenizeQuery`: Tokenizes the latest user-submitted question using the tokenizer specified in the current RAG configuration. This tool must be used *after* calling 'configure_rag' (to initialize the config) and 'store_user_query' (to capture a user question). It selects the most recent row from the query table (e.g., 'pdf_topics_of_interest'), runs it through the ONNX tokenizer, and creates a temporary view '<query_db>.v_topics_tokenized' containing 'id', 'txt', 'input_ids', and 'attention_mask'. This view is used downstream to generate vector embeddings for similarity search.
- `rag_createEmbeddingView`: Generates sentence embeddings for the most recent tokenized user query using the model specified in the RAG configuration. Reads from the view `<db>.v_topics_tokenized` and applies the ONNX model from `<model_db>.embeddings_models`. Creates or replaces the view `<db>.v_topics_embeddings` which includes the original input and a `sentence_embedding` column. This must be run *after* create_tokenized_view and before vector_to_columns().
- `rag_createQueryEmbeddingTable`: Converts the sentence embedding from the view `v_topics_embeddings` into 384 vector columns using `ivsm.vector_to_columns`. Creates or replaces a physical table to store the latest query embeddings for use in similarity search. The table location is defined via `rag_set_config`. This tool must be run *after* `create_embedding_view` and before `semantic_search_chunks`.
- `rag_semanticSearchChunks`: Retrieve top-k most relevant PDF chunks for the user's latest embedded query. This tool is part of the RAG workflow and should be called after the query has been embedded. If the RAG config has not been set, use `rag_set_config` first to define where queries, models, and chunk embeddings are stored. Uses cosine similarity via `TD_VECTORDISTANCE` to compare embeddings. Each result includes similarity score, chunk text, page number, chunk number, and document name.
- `sec_userDbPermissions`: Get permissions for a user.
- `sec_rolePermissions`: Get permissions for a role.
- `sec_userRoles`: Get roles assigned to a user.
- `reconnect_to_database`: Reconnect to the Teradata database if the connection is lost.
- `fs_setFeatureStoreConfig`: Set or update the feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- `fs_getFeatureStoreConfig`: Display the current feature store configuration (database and data domain).
- `fs_isFeatureStorePresent`: Check if a feature store is present in the specified database.
- `fs_featureStoreContent`: Returns a summary of the feature store content. Use this to understand what data is available in the feature store
- `fs_getDataDomains`: List the available data domains. Requires a configured `db_name`  in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- `fs_getFeatures`: List the list of features. Requires a configured `db_name` and  `data_domain` in the feature store config. Use this to explore the features available .
- `fs_getAvailableDatasets`: List the list of available datasets.Requires a configured `db_name` in the feature store config.Use this to explore the datasets that are available .
- `fs_getFeatureDataModel`: Return the schema of the feature store.Requires a feature store in the configured database (`db_name`).
- `fs_getAvailableEntities`: List the available entities for a given data domain. Requires a configured `db_name` and `data_domain` and  `entity` in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- `fs_createDataset`: Create a dataset using selected features and an entity from the feature store. The dataset is created in the specified target database under the given name. Requires a configured feature store and data domain. Registers the dataset in the catalog automatically. Use this when you want to build and register a new dataset for analysis or modeling.
- `get_cust_activeUsers`: Fetch currently active database users
- `get_td_serverInfo`: Get the Teradata software information: demonstrates how to use parameters for prepared statements.
- `get_cube_cube_db_space_metrics`: 
    Tool to query the cube 'table_skew_pct'.
    Get the Teradata database space metrics for tables and databases

    Expected inputs:
        dimensions (str): Comma-separated dimension names to group by. Allowed values:
    - DatabaseName: Name of the database

[model]: FINAL_ANSWER: The Teradata system contains the following databases: TD_SYSXML, DEMO_Customer360_db, gs_tables_db, TD_SYSGPL, SYSJDBC, TD_SYSFNLIB, TD_ANALYTICS_DB, SYSLIB, SQLJ, TDaaS_DB, dbcmngr, TDStats, SYSBAR, TDQCD, GLOBAL_FUNCTIONS, system, TDBCMgmt, SYSUDTLIB, TD_SERVER_DB, SYSSPATIAL, DEMO_Customer360, DEMO_DigitalEvents, DEMO_DigitalEvents_db, SYSUIF, and modelops.  There are also several users listed, which are not databases.

[user]: what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?
[model]: Thought:The user is asking for a list of tables within the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. The `base_tableList` tool is appropriate for this request.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"
  }
}
```

[user]: Based on the history, what is the next action to complete the user's request? If you have enough information, your response **MUST** start with `FINAL_ANSWER:`. Otherwise, provide the JSON for the next tool call.

The last tool execution returned the following result. Use this to inform your next action:

{"tool_name": "base_tableList", "tool_output": {"status": "success", "metadata": {"tool_name": "base_tableList", "database": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_count": 2}, "results": [{"TableName": "Equipment"}, {"TableName": "CallCenter"}]}}
[model]: FINAL_ANSWER: The DEMO_Customer360_db database contains two tables: Equipment and CallCenter.

[user]: what is the quality of Equipment?
[model]: Thought:The user is asking about the quality of the `Equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database.  This requires a multi-step approach to assess data quality. I will start by using `qlty_columnSummary` to get an overview of the column statistics.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "Equipment"
  }
}
```

The last tool execution returned the following result. Use this to inform your next action:

{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "tool_output": {"status": "success", "metadata": {"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "table_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db.Equipment"}, "results": [{"ColumnName": "GENDER", "Datatype": "VARCHAR(1) CHARACTER SET LATIN", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "0", "ZeroCount": "None", "PositiveCount": "None", "NegativeCount": "None", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "ADDRESS", "Datatype": "VARCHAR(25) CHARACTER SET LATIN", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "0", "ZeroCount": "None", "PositiveCount": "None", "NegativeCount": "None", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "CUST_ID", "Datatype": "SMALLINT", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "None", "ZeroCount": "0", "PositiveCount": "100", "NegativeCount": "0", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "FIRSTNAME", "Datatype": "VARCHAR(11) CHARACTER SET LATIN", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "0", "ZeroCount": "None", "PositiveCount": "None", "NegativeCount": "None", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "ZIP", "Datatype": "INTEGER", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "None", "ZeroCount": "0", "PositiveCount": "100", "NegativeCount": "0", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "CITY", "Datatype": "VARCHAR(16) CHARACTER SET LATIN", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "0", "ZeroCount": "None", "PositiveCount": "None", "NegativeCount": "None", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "LASTNAME", "Datatype": "VARCHAR(9) CHARACTER SET LATIN", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "0", "ZeroCount": "None", "PositiveCount": "None", "NegativeCount": "None", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "STATE", "Datatype": "VARCHAR(2) CHARACTER SET LATIN", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "0", "ZeroCount": "None", "PositiveCount": "None", "NegativeCount": "None", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}, {"ColumnName": "EQUIP_LTV", "Datatype": "SMALLINT", "NonNullCount": "100", "NullCount": "0", "BlankCount": "None", "ZeroCount": "0", "PositiveCount": "100", "NegativeCount": "0", "NullPercentage": "0.0", "NonNullPercentage": "100.0"}]}}
[model]: Thought:The `qlty_columnSummary` results show that the `Equipment` table has no missing values (NullCount = 0 for all columns) and no blank values (BlankCount = 0 for all columns).  All numeric columns have only positive values (except for `CUST_ID` and `EQUIP_LTV`, which have zeros but are valid). This suggests good data quality in terms of completeness and validity. To further enhance the assessment, let's check for other potential quality issues using `qlty_missingValues` and `qlty_negativeValues`.  However, based on the summary, the initial assessment is positive.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "qlty_missingValues",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "Equipment"
  }
}
```

[model]: Thought:The `qlty_missingValues` tool confirms that there are no missing values in any column of the `Equipment` table.  Let's proceed with checking for negative values.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "qlty_negativeValues",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "Equipment"
  }

[model]: FINAL_ANSWER: Based on the analysis from `qlty_columnSummary`, `qlty_missingValues`, and `qlty_negativeValues`, the Equipment table exhibits high data quality. There are no missing values, no blank values, and no negative values in the numeric columns.  The data appears complete and valid.

[user]: what is the business definition of equipment?
[model]: Thought:The user requests a business definition of the `Equipment` table.  The `base_tableBusinessDesc` prompt is best suited for this.

```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "Equipment"
  }

2025-07-26 18:50:51,824 - --- RESPONSE ---
Thought:Phase 1 is complete. The `base_tableDDL` tool successfully retrieved the DDL for the `Equipment` table.  The next step, Phase 2, requires creating a business description based on this DDL.  This will involve a prompt, not a tool call.  I will construct the description based on the DDL. The DDL is formatted for readability.

FINAL_ANSWER: ***Table Name:*** `Equipment`

***Database Name:*** `DEMO_Customer360_db`

***Description:*** The `Equipment` table stores information about customers and their associated equipment.  It likely represents a customer's ownership or usage of equipment.

 - ***CUST_ID:*** Customer identifier, uniquely identifying each customer.
 - ***GENDER:*** Customer's gender.
 - ***FIRSTNAME:*** Customer's first name.
 - ***LASTNAME:*** Customer's last name.
 - ***ADDRESS:*** Customer's street address.
 - ***STATE:*** Customer's state (abbreviation).
 - ***CITY:*** Customer's city.
 - ***ZIP:*** Customer's zip code.
 - ***EQUIP_LTV:***  Likely represents the Loan-to-Value ratio of the equipment, indicating the financial value relative to the loan amount.
