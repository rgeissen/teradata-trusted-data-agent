--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Generating a strategic meta-plan for the goal: 'how many databases are on the system?'

[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prompt First for Defined Workflows:** If the user's request is a strong semantic match for the description of an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts represent pre-defined, multi-step workflows and are the preferred method for common, complex tasks.
2.  **Tools for Direct Actions:** If no prompt is a direct match, analyze the request for a direct action or analysis. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action. Prioritize tools that use the most specific entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned).

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about data quality, but it's not a broad request for a "description". No prompt is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: select a tool for a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is a "business description". I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): how many databases are on the system?
- Workflow History (Actions taken so far): []
- Known Entities (Key information discovered so far): {}
- Current Execution Depth: 0 (Max is 5)

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal and Context**: Carefully read the "GOAL" and review the "CONTEXT" section to understand the user's full intent and what has already been established.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Contextual Prioritization):** You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in `Known Entities`. The `Known Entities` memory is only for supplementing the `GOAL` (e.g., filling in a missing `database_name`), not for overriding it.

    **Example of Correct Prioritization:**
    * If the `GOAL` is "analyze quality of **'equipment'**".
    * And `Known Entities` contains `{"table_name": "CallCenter"}`.
    * You **MUST** create a plan to analyze the **"equipment"** table. You **MUST NOT** use the stale "CallCenter" entity from memory.
3.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
4.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase.
    -   To specify the action, you MUST use ONE of the following keys:
        -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of `(tool)` names permitted for this phase.
        -   `"executable_prompt"`: The name of a single `(prompt)` to execute for this phase.
    -   (Optional) `"arguments"`: If executing a prompt, provide any known arguments for it here.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
5.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
6.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process that requires a final summary or a specifically formatted report, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase. This phase **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool. Crucially, the `task_description` for this `CoreLLMTask` **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main "GOAL" itself. This ensures that all original context and formatting instructions are passed to the final synthesis step.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call or a single prompt execution, your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate capability. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action or a prompt execution. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You MUST NOT create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5, as this may cause an infinite loop. Also, if the "CONTEXT" section indicates you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again via `executable_prompt`.
10. **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.
11. **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested loops or structures. To handle requests that imply nested logic (e.g., "for each X, do Y for each Z"), you **MUST** decompose the task into multiple, sequential looping phases. The first phase gathers and flattens all the items from the nested level, and subsequent phases iterate over that single flattened list.

--- EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic) ---
- **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
- **Thought Process**: This requires a nested loop (databases -> tables). I must flatten this into two sequential phases.
- **Correct Plan**:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "First, get a list of all databases. Then, loop over each database to get its tables, collecting all table names into a single flat list for the next phase.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_0",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Now, loop over the flattened list of table names gathered in Phase 1 and get the DDL for each one.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

2.  **Tools for Direct Actions:** If no prompt is a direct match, analyze the request for a direct action or analysis. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action. Prioritize tools that use the most specific entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned).

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about data quality, but it's not a broad request for a "description". No prompt is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: select a tool for a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is a "business description". I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): how many databases are on the system?
- Workflow History (Actions taken so far): []
- Known Entities (Key information discovered so far): {}
- Current Execution Depth: 0 (Max is 5)

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal and Context**: Carefully read the "GOAL" and review the "CONTEXT" section to understand the user's full intent and what has already been established.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Contextual Prioritization):** You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in `Known Entities`. The `Known Entities` memory is only for supplementing the `GOAL` (e.g., filling in a missing `database_name`), not for overriding it.

    **Example of Correct Prioritization:**
    * If the `GOAL` is "analyze quality of **'equipment'**".
    * And `Known Entities` contains `{"table_name": "CallCenter"}`.
    * You **MUST** create a plan to analyze the **"equipment"** table. You **MUST NOT** use the stale "CallCenter" entity from memory.
3.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
4.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase.
    -   To specify the action, you MUST use ONE of the following keys:
        -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of `(tool)` names permitted for this phase.
        -   `"executable_prompt"`: The name of a single `(prompt)` to execute for this phase.
    -   (Optional) `"arguments"`: If executing a prompt, provide any known arguments for it here.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
5.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
6.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process that requires a final summary or a specifically formatted report, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase. This phase **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool. Crucially, the `task_description` for this `CoreLLMTask` **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main "GOAL" itself. This ensures that all original context and formatting instructions are passed to the final synthesis step.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call or a single prompt execution, your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate capability. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action or a prompt execution. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You MUST NOT create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5, as this may cause an infinite loop. Also, if the "CONTEXT" section indicates you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again via `executable_prompt`.
10. **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.
11. **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested loops or structures. To handle requests that imply nested logic (e.g., "for each X, do Y for each Z"), you **MUST** decompose the task into multiple, sequential looping phases. The first phase gathers and flattens all the items from the nested level, and subsequent phases iterate over that single flattened list.

--- EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic) ---
- **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
- **Thought Process**: This requires a nested loop (databases -> tables). I must flatten this into two sequential phases.
- **Correct Plan**:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "First, get a list of all databases. Then, loop over each database to get its tables, collecting all table names into a single flat list for the next phase.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_0",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Now, loop over the flattened list of table names gathered in Phase 1 and get the DDL for each one.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

[model]: ```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Determine how many databases are on the system by listing all databases.",
    "relevant_tools": [
      "base_databaseList"
    ]
  }
]
```

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are a tactical assistant executing a single phase of a larger plan. Your task is to decide the single best next action to take to achieve the current phase's goal, strictly adhering to the provided tool constraints.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
Determine how many databases are on the system by listing all databases.

--- CONSTRAINTS ---
- Permitted Tools for this Phase (You MUST use the exact argument names provided):

- Tool: `base_databaseList`
  - Description: Lists all databases in the Teradata System.

- Previous Attempt (if any): None

--- WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY ---
- Actions Taken So Far: []
- Data Collected So Far: {}


--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection & Arguments)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool. Furthermore, you **MUST** use the exact argument names as they are defined in the tool details above. You **MUST NOT** invent, hallucinate, or use any arguments that are not explicitly listed in the definitions.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If you are in a looping phase (indicated by the presence of a "LOOP CONTEXT" section), you **MUST** focus your action on the single item provided in `current_loop_item`. You **MUST** use the information within that item to formulate the arguments for your tool call.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

--- ADDITIONAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {{"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {{"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.

2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.

3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.

2025-08-24 13:26:42,397 - --- RESPONSE ---
Key Metric: {"value": "21", "label": "Number of databases"}
There are 21 databases on the system.

## Key Observations

*   The query executed successfully, returning 50 rows.
*   The query lists both databases and users, distinguishing them by the `DBType` column.
*   The `DBType` column indicates whether each entry is a 'User' or a 'DataBase'.
*   The `DataBaseName` column lists the names of the databases and users.
*   The `CommentString` column provides additional information about each database or user, such as its purpose or creator.
*   There are several databases related to "As-A-Service", indicated by "TDaaS" in their names, along with associated users for management, monitoring, support and maintenance.
*   There are databases and users related to demos, such as `DEMO_Customer360_db`, `DEMO_DigitalEvents_db`, and `demo_user`.
*   System-related databases and users are also present, such as `TD_SYSXML`, `SYSJDBC`, `DBC`, and `SysAdmin`.
*   Counting the entries where `DBType` is 'DataBase' results in a count of 21.

--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Generating a strategic meta-plan for the goal: 'what's in demo_customer360_db?'

--- History (History Disabled: False) ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prompt First for Defined Workflows:** If the user's request is a strong semantic match for the description of an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts represent pre-defined, multi-step workflows and are the preferred method for common, complex tasks.
2.  **Tools for Direct Actions:** If no prompt is a direct match, analyze the request for a direct action or analysis. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action. Prioritize tools that use the most specific entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned).

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about data quality, but it's not a broad request for a "description". No prompt is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: select a tool for a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is a "business description". I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): how many databases are on the system?
- Workflow History (Actions taken so far): []
- Known Entities (Key information discovered so far): {}
- Current Execution Depth: 0 (Max is 5)

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal and Context**: Carefully read the "GOAL" and review the "CONTEXT" section to understand the user's full intent and what has already been established.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Contextual Prioritization):** You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in `Known Entities`. The `Known Entities` memory is only for supplementing the `GOAL` (e.g., filling in a missing `database_name`), not for overriding it.

    **Example of Correct Prioritization:**
    * If the `GOAL` is "analyze quality of **'equipment'**".
    * And `Known Entities` contains `{"table_name": "CallCenter"}`.
    * You **MUST** create a plan to analyze the **"equipment"** table. You **MUST NOT** use the stale "CallCenter" entity from memory.
3.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
4.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase.
    -   To specify the action, you MUST use ONE of the following keys:
        -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of `(tool)` names permitted for this phase.
        -   `"executable_prompt"`: The name of a single `(prompt)` to execute for this phase.
    -   (Optional) `"arguments"`: If executing a prompt, provide any known arguments for it here.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
5.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
6.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process that requires a final summary or a specifically formatted report, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase. This phase **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool. Crucially, the `task_description` for this `CoreLLMTask` **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main "GOAL" itself. This ensures that all original context and formatting instructions are passed to the final synthesis step.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call or a single prompt execution, your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate capability. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action or a prompt execution. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You MUST NOT create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5, as this may cause an infinite loop. Also, if the "CONTEXT" section indicates you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again via `executable_prompt`.
10. **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.
11. **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested loops or structures. To handle requests that imply nested logic (e.g., "for each X, do Y for each Z"), you **MUST** decompose the task into multiple, sequential looping phases. The first phase gathers and flattens all the items from the nested level, and subsequent phases iterate over that single flattened list.

--- EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic) ---
- **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
- **Thought Process**: This requires a nested loop (databases -> tables). I must flatten this into two sequential phases.
- **Correct Plan**:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "First, get a list of all databases. Then, loop over each database to get its tables, collecting all table names into a single flat list for the next phase.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_0",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Now, loop over the flattened list of table names gathered in Phase 1 and get the DDL for each one.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

[model]: ```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Determine how many databases are on the system by listing all databases.",
    "relevant_tools": [
      "base_databaseList"
    ]
  }
]
```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are a tactical assistant executing a single phase of a larger plan. Your task is to decide the single best next action to take to achieve the current phase's goal, strictly adhering to the provided tool constraints.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
Determine how many databases are on the system by listing all databases.

--- CONSTRAINTS ---
- Permitted Tools for this Phase (You MUST use the exact argument names provided):

- Tool: `base_databaseList`
  - Description: Lists all databases in the Teradata System.

- Previous Attempt (if any): None

--- WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY ---
- Actions Taken So Far: []
- Data Collected So Far: {}


--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection & Arguments)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool. Furthermore, you **MUST** use the exact argument names as they are defined in the tool details above. You **MUST NOT** invent, hallucinate, or use any arguments that are not explicitly listed in the definitions.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If you are in a looping phase (indicated by the presence of a "LOOP CONTEXT" section), you **MUST** focus your action on the single item provided in `current_loop_item`. You **MUST** use the information within that item to formulate the arguments for your tool call.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.


USER PROMPT:
Determine the next action based on the instructions and state provided in the system prompt.
[model]: ```json
{"tool_name": "base_databaseList", "arguments": {}}
```

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prompt First for Defined Workflows:** If the user's request is a strong semantic match for the description of an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts represent pre-defined, multi-step workflows and are the preferred method for common, complex tasks.
2.  **Tools for Direct Actions:** If no prompt is a direct match, analyze the request for a direct action or analysis. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action. Prioritize tools that use the most specific entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned).

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about data quality, but it's not a broad request for a "description". No prompt is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: select a tool for a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is a "business description". I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
what's in demo_customer360_db?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): what's in demo_customer360_db?
- Workflow History (Actions taken so far): []
- Known Entities (Key information discovered so far): {
  "database_name": "SYSUIF"
}
- Current Execution Depth: 0 (Max is 5)

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal and Context**: Carefully read the "GOAL" and review the "CONTEXT" section to understand the user's full intent and what has already been established.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Contextual Prioritization):** You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in `Known Entities`. The `Known Entities` memory is only for supplementing the `GOAL` (e.g., filling in a missing `database_name`), not for overriding it.

    **Example of Correct Prioritization:**
    * If the `GOAL` is "analyze quality of **'equipment'**".
    * And `Known Entities` contains `{"table_name": "CallCenter"}`.
    * You **MUST** create a plan to analyze the **"equipment"** table. You **MUST NOT** use the stale "CallCenter" entity from memory.
3.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
4.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase.
    -   To specify the action, you MUST use ONE of the following keys:
        -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of `(tool)` names permitted for this phase.
        -   `"executable_prompt"`: The name of a single `(prompt)` to execute for this phase.
    -   (Optional) `"arguments"`: If executing a prompt, provide any known arguments for it here.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
5.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
6.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process that requires a final summary or a specifically formatted report, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase. This phase **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool. Crucially, the `task_description` for this `CoreLLMTask` **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main "GOAL" itself. This ensures that all original context and formatting instructions are passed to the final synthesis step.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call or a single prompt execution, your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate capability. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action or a prompt execution. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You MUST NOT create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5, as this may cause an infinite loop. Also, if the "CONTEXT" section indicates you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again via `executable_prompt`.
10. **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.
11. **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested loops or structures. To handle requests that imply nested logic (e.g., "for each X, do Y for each Z"), you **MUST** decompose the task into multiple, sequential looping phases. The first phase gathers and flattens all the items from the nested level, and subsequent phases iterate over that single flattened list.

--- EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic) ---
- **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
- **Thought Process**: This requires a nested loop (databases -> tables). I must flatten this into two sequential phases.
- **Correct Plan**:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "First, get a list of all databases. Then, loop over each database to get its tables, collecting all table names into a single flat list for the next phase.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_0",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Now, loop over the flattened list of table names gathered in Phase 1 and get the DDL for each one.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

--- History (History Disabled: False) ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prompt First for Defined Workflows:** If the user's request is a strong semantic match for the description of an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts represent pre-defined, multi-step workflows and are the preferred method for common, complex tasks.
2.  **Tools for Direct Actions:** If no prompt is a direct match, analyze the request for a direct action or analysis. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action. Prioritize tools that use the most specific entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned).

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about data quality, but it's not a broad request for a "description". No prompt is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: select a tool for a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is a "business description". I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): how many databases are on the system?
- Workflow History (Actions taken so far): []
- Known Entities (Key information discovered so far): {}
- Current Execution Depth: 0 (Max is 5)

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal and Context**: Carefully read the "GOAL" and review the "CONTEXT" section to understand the user's full intent and what has already been established.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Contextual Prioritization):** You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in `Known Entities`. The `Known Entities` memory is only for supplementing the `GOAL` (e.g., filling in a missing `database_name`), not for overriding it.

    **Example of Correct Prioritization:**
    * If the `GOAL` is "analyze quality of **'equipment'**".
    * And `Known Entities` contains `{"table_name": "CallCenter"}`.
    * You **MUST** create a plan to analyze the **"equipment"** table. You **MUST NOT** use the stale "CallCenter" entity from memory.
3.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
4.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase.
    -   To specify the action, you MUST use ONE of the following keys:
        -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of `(tool)` names permitted for this phase.
        -   `"executable_prompt"`: The name of a single `(prompt)` to execute for this phase.
    -   (Optional) `"arguments"`: If executing a prompt, provide any known arguments for it here.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
5.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
6.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process that requires a final summary or a specifically formatted report, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase. This phase **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool. Crucially, the `task_description` for this `CoreLLMTask` **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main "GOAL" itself. This ensures that all original context and formatting instructions are passed to the final synthesis step.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call or a single prompt execution, your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate capability. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action or a prompt execution. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You MUST NOT create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5, as this may cause an infinite loop. Also, if the "CONTEXT" section indicates you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again via `executable_prompt`.
10. **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.
11. **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested loops or structures. To handle requests that imply nested logic (e.g., "for each X, do Y for each Z"), you **MUST** decompose the task into multiple, sequential looping phases. The first phase gathers and flattens all the items from the nested level, and subsequent phases iterate over that single flattened list.

--- EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic) ---
- **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
- **Thought Process**: This requires a nested loop (databases -> tables). I must flatten this into two sequential phases.
- **Correct Plan**:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "First, get a list of all databases. Then, loop over each database to get its tables, collecting all table names into a single flat list for the next phase.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_0",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Now, loop over the flattened list of table names gathered in Phase 1 and get the DDL for each one.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

[model]: ```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Determine how many databases are on the system by listing all databases.",
    "relevant_tools": [
      "base_databaseList"
    ]
  }
]
```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are a tactical assistant executing a single phase of a larger plan. Your task is to decide the single best next action to take to achieve the current phase's goal, strictly adhering to the provided tool constraints.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
Determine how many databases are on the system by listing all databases.

--- CONSTRAINTS ---
- Permitted Tools for this Phase (You MUST use the exact argument names provided):

- Tool: `base_databaseList`
  - Description: Lists all databases in the Teradata System.

- Previous Attempt (if any): None

--- WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY ---
- Actions Taken So Far: []
- Data Collected So Far: {}


--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection & Arguments)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool. Furthermore, you **MUST** use the exact argument names as they are defined in the tool details above. You **MUST NOT** invent, hallucinate, or use any arguments that are not explicitly listed in the definitions.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If you are in a looping phase (indicated by the presence of a "LOOP CONTEXT" section), you **MUST** focus your action on the single item provided in `current_loop_item`. You **MUST** use the information within that item to formulate the arguments for your tool call.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.


USER PROMPT:
Determine the next action based on the instructions and state provided in the system prompt.
[model]: ```json
{"tool_name": "base_databaseList", "arguments": {}}
```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prompt First for Defined Workflows:** If the user's request is a strong semantic match for the description of an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts represent pre-defined, multi-step workflows and are the preferred method for common, complex tasks.
2.  **Tools for Direct Actions:** If no prompt is a direct match, analyze the request for a direct action or analysis. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action. Prioritize tools that use the most specific entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned).

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about data quality, but it's not a broad request for a "description". No prompt is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: select a tool for a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is a "business description". I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
what's in demo_customer360_db?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): what's in demo_customer360_db?
- Workflow History (Actions taken so far): []
- Known Entities (Key information discovered so far): {
  "database_name": "SYSUIF"
}
- Current Execution Depth: 0 (Max is 5)

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal and Context**: Carefully read the "GOAL" and review the "CONTEXT" section to understand the user's full intent and what has already been established.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Contextual Prioritization):** You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in `Known Entities`. The `Known Entities` memory is only for supplementing the `GOAL` (e.g., filling in a missing `database_name`), not for overriding it.

    **Example of Correct Prioritization:**
    * If the `GOAL` is "analyze quality of **'equipment'**".
    * And `Known Entities` contains `{"table_name": "CallCenter"}`.
    * You **MUST** create a plan to analyze the **"equipment"** table. You **MUST NOT** use the stale "CallCenter" entity from memory.
3.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
4.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase.
    -   To specify the action, you MUST use ONE of the following keys:
        -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of `(tool)` names permitted for this phase.
        -   `"executable_prompt"`: The name of a single `(prompt)` to execute for this phase.
    -   (Optional) `"arguments"`: If executing a prompt, provide any known arguments for it here.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
5.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
6.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process that requires a final summary or a specifically formatted report, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase. This phase **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool. Crucially, the `task_description` for this `CoreLLMTask` **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main "GOAL" itself. This ensures that all original context and formatting instructions are passed to the final synthesis step.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call or a single prompt execution, your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate capability. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action or a prompt execution. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You MUST NOT create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5, as this may cause an infinite loop. Also, if the "CONTEXT" section indicates you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again via `executable_prompt`.
10. **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.
11. **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested loops or structures. To handle requests that imply nested logic (e.g., "for each X, do Y for each Z"), you **MUST** decompose the task into multiple, sequential looping phases. The first phase gathers and flattens all the items from the nested level, and subsequent phases iterate over that single flattened list.

--- EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic) ---
- **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
- **Thought Process**: This requires a nested loop (databases -> tables). I must flatten this into two sequential phases.
- **Correct Plan**:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "First, get a list of all databases. Then, loop over each database to get its tables, collecting all table names into a single flat list for the next phase.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_0",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Now, loop over the flattened list of table names gathered in Phase 1 and get the DDL for each one.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

[model]: ```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "To determine what's in the demo_customer360_db, the tables in the database must be listed.",

      "base_tableList"
    ],
    "arguments": {
      "database_name": "demo_customer360_db"
    }
  }
]
```

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are a tactical assistant executing a single phase of a larger plan. Your task is to decide the single best next action to take to achieve the current phase's goal, strictly adhering to the provided tool constraints.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
what's in demo_customer360_db?

--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
To determine what's in the demo_customer360_db, the tables in the database must be listed.

--- CONSTRAINTS ---
- Permitted Tools for this Phase (You MUST use the exact argument names provided):

- Tool: `base_tableList`
  - Description: Lists all tables in a database.
  - Arguments:
    - `database_name` (string, required): Database Name

- Previous Attempt (if any): None

--- WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY ---
- Actions Taken So Far: []
- Data Collected So Far: {}


--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection & Arguments)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool. Furthermore, you **MUST** use the exact argument names as they are defined in the tool details above. You **MUST NOT** invent, hallucinate, or use any arguments that are not explicitly listed in the definitions.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If you are in a looping phase (indicated by the presence of a "LOOP CONTEXT" section), you **MUST** focus your action on the single item provided in `current_loop_item`. You **MUST** use the information within that item to formulate the arguments for your tool call.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.

      ]
    }
  ]
}

--- KNOWN CONTEXT ---
The following key information has already been established in previous steps. You MUST use this information to populate header fields like 'Table Name' or 'Database Name'.
None

--- SEMANTIC GUIDANCE ---
When the 'TASK' asks for a 'description', 'analysis', or 'summary', you MUST synthesize new content that reflects the *semantic intent* of the request.
For example:
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'business description of a table', you MUST explain its purpose from an organizational, functional, or analytical viewpoint, and the business significance of its columns. Do NOT simply reiterate technical DDL (Data Definition Language) information, even if it is present in the `RELEVANT DATA`.
- If the 'TASK' asks for a 'summary of errors', you MUST provide a concise overview of the issues, not just a list of error codes.
Always prioritize generating content that matches the *meaning* and *purpose* of the 'TASK', interpreting the raw data to produce the desired semantic output.

--- CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Separate Data from Description:** If the 'TASK' requires you to output header fields (like `***Table Name:***` or `***Database Name:***`) AND a main description, you MUST treat these as separate steps. First, populate the header fields using the 'KNOWN CONTEXT'. Then, write the main description. Do NOT merge context data (like the database name) into a single header field.
2. **Content and Formatting Precision:** You MUST adhere to any and all formatting instructions contained in the 'TASK' description with absolute precision. Do not deviate, simplify, or change the requested format in any way. You MUST generate content that genuinely fulfills the semantic goal of the 'TASK'.
3. **Key Name Adherence:** If the 'TASK' description provides an example format, you MUST use the exact key names (e.g., `***Description:***`, `***Table Name:***`) shown in the example. Do not invent new key names or use synonyms like 'Table Description'.
4. **Column Placeholder Replacement:** If the 'TASK' involves describing table columns and the formatting guidelines include a placeholder like `***ColumnX:***` or `***[Column Name]:***`, you MUST replace that placeholder with the actual name of the column you are describing (e.g., `***CUST_ID:***`, `***FIRSTNAME:***`). Do not use generic, numbered placeholders like 'Column1', 'Column2', etc.
5. **Layout and Line Breaks:** Each key-value pair or list item specified in the formatting guidelines MUST be on its own separate line. Do not combine multiple items onto a single line.

--- ADDITIONAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS ---
Your entire response MUST be formatted in standard markdown and MUST be structured as follows:

1.  **(Optional) Key Metric:** If the answer to the user's question can be summarized by a single primary value (either quantitative like a number, or qualitative like a status), you MUST provide it on the very first line in a specific JSON format. The line must start with `Key Metric: ` followed by a JSON object with a `value` (as a string) and a `label` (a short description).
    - Quantitative Example: `Key Metric: {{"value": "21", "label": "Databases on system"}}`
    - Qualitative Example: `Key Metric: {{"value": "High", "label": "System Utilization"}}`
    If there is no single primary value, you MUST omit this line entirely.

2.  **The Direct Answer:** This part MUST immediately follow the Key Metric (or be the first line if no metric is provided). It must be a single, concise sentence that directly and factually answers the user's question.

3.  **Key Observations:** This section MUST start with a level-2 markdown heading (`## Key Observations`). It should contain a bulleted list of all supporting details and context.

Your response should be the direct result of the task. Do not add any conversational text or extra formatting unless explicitly requested by the task description.

2025-08-24 13:27:10,867 - --- RESPONSE ---
The demo_customer360_db database contains two tables: Equipment and CallCenter.

## Key Observations

*   The database contains two tables named "Equipment" and "CallCenter".
*   The query used to identify the tables searched the `dbc.TablesV` system view.
*   The query filtered for tables with a `TableKind` of 'T', 'V', 'O', or 'Q'.

[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prompt First for Defined Workflows:** If the user's request is a strong semantic match for the description of an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts represent pre-defined, multi-step workflows and are the preferred method for common, complex tasks.
2.  **Tools for Direct Actions:** If no prompt is a direct match, analyze the request for a direct action or analysis. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action. Prioritize tools that use the most specific entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned).

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about data quality, but it's not a broad request for a "description". No prompt is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: select a tool for a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is a "business description". I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): how many databases are on the system?
- Workflow History (Actions taken so far): []
- Known Entities (Key information discovered so far): {}
- Current Execution Depth: 0 (Max is 5)

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal and Context**: Carefully read the "GOAL" and review the "CONTEXT" section to understand the user's full intent and what has already been established.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Contextual Prioritization):** You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in `Known Entities`. The `Known Entities` memory is only for supplementing the `GOAL` (e.g., filling in a missing `database_name`), not for overriding it.

    **Example of Correct Prioritization:**
    * If the `GOAL` is "analyze quality of **'equipment'**".
    * And `Known Entities` contains `{"table_name": "CallCenter"}`.
    * You **MUST** create a plan to analyze the **"equipment"** table. You **MUST NOT** use the stale "CallCenter" entity from memory.
3.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
4.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase.
    -   To specify the action, you MUST use ONE of the following keys:
        -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of `(tool)` names permitted for this phase.
        -   `"executable_prompt"`: The name of a single `(prompt)` to execute for this phase.
    -   (Optional) `"arguments"`: If executing a prompt, provide any known arguments for it here.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
5.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
6.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process that requires a final summary or a specifically formatted report, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase. This phase **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool. Crucially, the `task_description` for this `CoreLLMTask` **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main "GOAL" itself. This ensures that all original context and formatting instructions are passed to the final synthesis step.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call or a single prompt execution, your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate capability. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action or a prompt execution. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You MUST NOT create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5, as this may cause an infinite loop. Also, if the "CONTEXT" section indicates you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again via `executable_prompt`.
10. **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.
11. **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested loops or structures. To handle requests that imply nested logic (e.g., "for each X, do Y for each Z"), you **MUST** decompose the task into multiple, sequential looping phases. The first phase gathers and flattens all the items from the nested level, and subsequent phases iterate over that single flattened list.

--- EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic) ---
- **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
- **Thought Process**: This requires a nested loop (databases -> tables). I must flatten this into two sequential phases.
- **Correct Plan**:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "First, get a list of all databases. Then, loop over each database to get its tables, collecting all table names into a single flat list for the next phase.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_0",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Now, loop over the flattened list of table names gathered in Phase 1 and get the DDL for each one.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

[model]: ```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Determine how many databases are on the system by listing all databases.",
    "relevant_tools": [
      "base_databaseList"
    ]
  }
]
```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are a tactical assistant executing a single phase of a larger plan. Your task is to decide the single best next action to take to achieve the current phase's goal, strictly adhering to the provided tool constraints.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
Determine how many databases are on the system by listing all databases.

--- CONSTRAINTS ---
- Permitted Tools for this Phase (You MUST use the exact argument names provided):

- Tool: `base_databaseList`
  - Description: Lists all databases in the Teradata System.

- Previous Attempt (if any): None

--- WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY ---
- Actions Taken So Far: []
- Data Collected So Far: {}


--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection & Arguments)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool. Furthermore, you **MUST** use the exact argument names as they are defined in the tool details above. You **MUST NOT** invent, hallucinate, or use any arguments that are not explicitly listed in the definitions.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If you are in a looping phase (indicated by the presence of a "LOOP CONTEXT" section), you **MUST** focus your action on the single item provided in `current_loop_item`. You **MUST** use the information within that item to formulate the arguments for your tool call.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.


USER PROMPT:
Determine the next action based on the instructions and state provided in the system prompt.
[model]: ```json
{"tool_name": "base_databaseList", "arguments": {}}
```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prompt First for Defined Workflows:** If the user's request is a strong semantic match for the description of an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts represent pre-defined, multi-step workflows and are the preferred method for common, complex tasks.
2.  **Tools for Direct Actions:** If no prompt is a direct match, analyze the request for a direct action or analysis. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action. Prioritize tools that use the most specific entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned).

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about data quality, but it's not a broad request for a "description". No prompt is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: select a tool for a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is a "business description". I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
what's in demo_customer360_db?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): what's in demo_customer360_db?
- Workflow History (Actions taken so far): []
- Known Entities (Key information discovered so far): {
  "database_name": "SYSUIF"
}
- Current Execution Depth: 0 (Max is 5)

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal and Context**: Carefully read the "GOAL" and review the "CONTEXT" section to understand the user's full intent and what has already been established.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Contextual Prioritization):** You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in `Known Entities`. The `Known Entities` memory is only for supplementing the `GOAL` (e.g., filling in a missing `database_name`), not for overriding it.

    **Example of Correct Prioritization:**
    * If the `GOAL` is "analyze quality of **'equipment'**".
    * And `Known Entities` contains `{"table_name": "CallCenter"}`.
    * You **MUST** create a plan to analyze the **"equipment"** table. You **MUST NOT** use the stale "CallCenter" entity from memory.
3.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
4.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase.
    -   To specify the action, you MUST use ONE of the following keys:
        -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of `(tool)` names permitted for this phase.
        -   `"executable_prompt"`: The name of a single `(prompt)` to execute for this phase.
    -   (Optional) `"arguments"`: If executing a prompt, provide any known arguments for it here.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
5.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
6.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process that requires a final summary or a specifically formatted report, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase. This phase **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool. Crucially, the `task_description` for this `CoreLLMTask` **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main "GOAL" itself. This ensures that all original context and formatting instructions are passed to the final synthesis step.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call or a single prompt execution, your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate capability. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action or a prompt execution. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You MUST NOT create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5, as this may cause an infinite loop. Also, if the "CONTEXT" section indicates you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again via `executable_prompt`.
10. **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.
11. **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested loops or structures. To handle requests that imply nested logic (e.g., "for each X, do Y for each Z"), you **MUST** decompose the task into multiple, sequential looping phases. The first phase gathers and flattens all the items from the nested level, and subsequent phases iterate over that single flattened list.

--- EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic) ---
- **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
- **Thought Process**: This requires a nested loop (databases -> tables). I must flatten this into two sequential phases.
- **Correct Plan**:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "First, get a list of all databases. Then, loop over each database to get its tables, collecting all table names into a single flat list for the next phase.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_0",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Now, loop over the flattened list of table names gathered in Phase 1 and get the DDL for each one.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

[model]: ```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "To determine what's in the demo_customer360_db, the tables in the database must be listed.",
    "relevant_tools": [
      "base_tableList"
    ],
    "arguments": {
      "database_name": "demo_customer360_db"
    }
  }
]
```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are a tactical assistant executing a single phase of a larger plan. Your task is to decide the single best next action to take to achieve the current phase's goal, strictly adhering to the provided tool constraints.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
what's in demo_customer360_db?

--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
To determine what's in the demo_customer360_db, the tables in the database must be listed.

--- CONSTRAINTS ---
- Permitted Tools for this Phase (You MUST use the exact argument names provided):

- Tool: `base_tableList`
  - Description: Lists all tables in a database.
  - Arguments:
    - `database_name` (string, required): Database Name

- Previous Attempt (if any): None

--- WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY ---
- Actions Taken So Far: []
- Data Collected So Far: {}


--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection & Arguments)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool. Furthermore, you **MUST** use the exact argument names as they are defined in the tool details above. You **MUST NOT** invent, hallucinate, or use any arguments that are not explicitly listed in the definitions.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If you are in a looping phase (indicated by the presence of a "LOOP CONTEXT" section), you **MUST** focus your action on the single item provided in `current_loop_item`. You **MUST** use the information within that item to formulate the arguments for your tool call.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.

To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prompt First for Defined Workflows:** If the user's request is a strong semantic match for the description of an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts represent pre-defined, multi-step workflows and are the preferred method for common, complex tasks.
2.  **Tools for Direct Actions:** If no prompt is a direct match, analyze the request for a direct action or analysis. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action. Prioritize tools that use the most specific entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned).

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about data quality, but it's not a broad request for a "description". No prompt is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: select a tool for a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is a "business description". I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
give me the business description of Equipment

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): give me the business description of Equipment
- Workflow History (Actions taken so far): []
- Known Entities (Key information discovered so far): {
  "database_name": "demo_customer360_db",
  "table_name": "CallCenter"
}
- Current Execution Depth: 0 (Max is 5)

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal and Context**: Carefully read the "GOAL" and review the "CONTEXT" section to understand the user's full intent and what has already been established.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Contextual Prioritization):** You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in `Known Entities`. The `Known Entities` memory is only for supplementing the `GOAL` (e.g., filling in a missing `database_name`), not for overriding it.

    **Example of Correct Prioritization:**
    * If the `GOAL` is "analyze quality of **'equipment'**".
    * And `Known Entities` contains `{"table_name": "CallCenter"}`.
    * You **MUST** create a plan to analyze the **"equipment"** table. You **MUST NOT** use the stale "CallCenter" entity from memory.
3.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
4.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase.
    -   To specify the action, you MUST use ONE of the following keys:
        -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of `(tool)` names permitted for this phase.
        -   `"executable_prompt"`: The name of a single `(prompt)` to execute for this phase.
    -   (Optional) `"arguments"`: If executing a prompt, provide any known arguments for it here.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
5.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
6.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process that requires a final summary or a specifically formatted report, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase. This phase **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool. Crucially, the `task_description` for this `CoreLLMTask` **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main "GOAL" itself. This ensures that all original context and formatting instructions are passed to the final synthesis step.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call or a single prompt execution, your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate capability. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action or a prompt execution. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You MUST NOT create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5, as this may cause an infinite loop. Also, if the "CONTEXT" section indicates you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again via `executable_prompt`.
10. **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.
11. **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested loops or structures. To handle requests that imply nested logic (e.g., "for each X, do Y for each Z"), you **MUST** decompose the task into multiple, sequential looping phases. The first phase gathers and flattens all the items from the nested level, and subsequent phases iterate over that single flattened list.

--- EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic) ---
- **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
- **Thought Process**: This requires a nested loop (databases -> tables). I must flatten this into two sequential phases.
- **Correct Plan**:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "First, get a list of all databases. Then, loop over each database to get its tables, collecting all table names into a single flat list for the next phase.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_0",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Now, loop over the flattened list of table names gathered in Phase 1 and get the DDL for each one.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prompt First for Defined Workflows:** If the user's request is a strong semantic match for the description of an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts represent pre-defined, multi-step workflows and are the preferred method for common, complex tasks.
2.  **Tools for Direct Actions:** If no prompt is a direct match, analyze the request for a direct action or analysis. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action. Prioritize tools that use the most specific entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned).

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about data quality, but it's not a broad request for a "description". No prompt is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: select a tool for a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is a "business description". I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): how many databases are on the system?
- Workflow History (Actions taken so far): []
- Known Entities (Key information discovered so far): {}
- Current Execution Depth: 0 (Max is 5)

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal and Context**: Carefully read the "GOAL" and review the "CONTEXT" section to understand the user's full intent and what has already been established.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Contextual Prioritization):** You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in `Known Entities`. The `Known Entities` memory is only for supplementing the `GOAL` (e.g., filling in a missing `database_name`), not for overriding it.

    **Example of Correct Prioritization:**
    * If the `GOAL` is "analyze quality of **'equipment'**".
    * And `Known Entities` contains `{"table_name": "CallCenter"}`.
    * You **MUST** create a plan to analyze the **"equipment"** table. You **MUST NOT** use the stale "CallCenter" entity from memory.
3.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
4.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase.
    -   To specify the action, you MUST use ONE of the following keys:
        -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of `(tool)` names permitted for this phase.
        -   `"executable_prompt"`: The name of a single `(prompt)` to execute for this phase.
    -   (Optional) `"arguments"`: If executing a prompt, provide any known arguments for it here.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
5.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
6.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process that requires a final summary or a specifically formatted report, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase. This phase **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool. Crucially, the `task_description` for this `CoreLLMTask` **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main "GOAL" itself. This ensures that all original context and formatting instructions are passed to the final synthesis step.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call or a single prompt execution, your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate capability. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action or a prompt execution. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You MUST NOT create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5, as this may cause an infinite loop. Also, if the "CONTEXT" section indicates you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again via `executable_prompt`.
10. **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.
11. **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested loops or structures. To handle requests that imply nested logic (e.g., "for each X, do Y for each Z"), you **MUST** decompose the task into multiple, sequential looping phases. The first phase gathers and flattens all the items from the nested level, and subsequent phases iterate over that single flattened list.

--- EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic) ---
- **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
- **Thought Process**: This requires a nested loop (databases -> tables). I must flatten this into two sequential phases.
- **Correct Plan**:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "First, get a list of all databases. Then, loop over each database to get its tables, collecting all table names into a single flat list for the next phase.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_0",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Now, loop over the flattened list of table names gathered in Phase 1 and get the DDL for each one.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

[model]: ```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Determine how many databases are on the system by listing all databases.",
    "relevant_tools": [
      "base_databaseList"
    ]
  }
]
```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are a tactical assistant executing a single phase of a larger plan. Your task is to decide the single best next action to take to achieve the current phase's goal, strictly adhering to the provided tool constraints.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
Determine how many databases are on the system by listing all databases.

--- CONSTRAINTS ---
- Permitted Tools for this Phase (You MUST use the exact argument names provided):

- Tool: `base_databaseList`
  - Description: Lists all databases in the Teradata System.

- Previous Attempt (if any): None

--- WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY ---
- Actions Taken So Far: []
- Data Collected So Far: {}


--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection & Arguments)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool. Furthermore, you **MUST** use the exact argument names as they are defined in the tool details above. You **MUST NOT** invent, hallucinate, or use any arguments that are not explicitly listed in the definitions.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If you are in a looping phase (indicated by the presence of a "LOOP CONTEXT" section), you **MUST** focus your action on the single item provided in `current_loop_item`. You **MUST** use the information within that item to formulate the arguments for your tool call.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.


USER PROMPT:
Determine the next action based on the instructions and state provided in the system prompt.
[model]: ```json
{"tool_name": "base_databaseList", "arguments": {}}
```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prompt First for Defined Workflows:** If the user's request is a strong semantic match for the description of an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts represent pre-defined, multi-step workflows and are the preferred method for common, complex tasks.
2.  **Tools for Direct Actions:** If no prompt is a direct match, analyze the request for a direct action or analysis. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action. Prioritize tools that use the most specific entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned).

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about data quality, but it's not a broad request for a "description". No prompt is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: select a tool for a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is a "business description". I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
what's in demo_customer360_db?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): what's in demo_customer360_db?
- Workflow History (Actions taken so far): []
- Known Entities (Key information discovered so far): {
  "database_name": "SYSUIF"
}
- Current Execution Depth: 0 (Max is 5)

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal and Context**: Carefully read the "GOAL" and review the "CONTEXT" section to understand the user's full intent and what has already been established.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Contextual Prioritization):** You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in `Known Entities`. The `Known Entities` memory is only for supplementing the `GOAL` (e.g., filling in a missing `database_name`), not for overriding it.

    **Example of Correct Prioritization:**
    * If the `GOAL` is "analyze quality of **'equipment'**".
    * And `Known Entities` contains `{"table_name": "CallCenter"}`.
    * You **MUST** create a plan to analyze the **"equipment"** table. You **MUST NOT** use the stale "CallCenter" entity from memory.
3.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
4.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase.
    -   To specify the action, you MUST use ONE of the following keys:
        -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of `(tool)` names permitted for this phase.
        -   `"executable_prompt"`: The name of a single `(prompt)` to execute for this phase.
    -   (Optional) `"arguments"`: If executing a prompt, provide any known arguments for it here.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
5.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
6.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process that requires a final summary or a specifically formatted report, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase. This phase **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool. Crucially, the `task_description` for this `CoreLLMTask` **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main "GOAL" itself. This ensures that all original context and formatting instructions are passed to the final synthesis step.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call or a single prompt execution, your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate capability. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action or a prompt execution. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You MUST NOT create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5, as this may cause an infinite loop. Also, if the "CONTEXT" section indicates you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again via `executable_prompt`.
10. **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.
11. **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested loops or structures. To handle requests that imply nested logic (e.g., "for each X, do Y for each Z"), you **MUST** decompose the task into multiple, sequential looping phases. The first phase gathers and flattens all the items from the nested level, and subsequent phases iterate over that single flattened list.

--- EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic) ---
- **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
- **Thought Process**: This requires a nested loop (databases -> tables). I must flatten this into two sequential phases.
- **Correct Plan**:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "First, get a list of all databases. Then, loop over each database to get its tables, collecting all table names into a single flat list for the next phase.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_0",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Now, loop over the flattened list of table names gathered in Phase 1 and get the DDL for each one.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

[model]: ```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "To determine what's in the demo_customer360_db, the tables in the database must be listed.",
    "relevant_tools": [
      "base_tableList"
    ],
    "arguments": {
      "database_name": "demo_customer360_db"
    }
  }
]
```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are a tactical assistant executing a single phase of a larger plan. Your task is to decide the single best next action to take to achieve the current phase's goal, strictly adhering to the provided tool constraints.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
what's in demo_customer360_db?

--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
To determine what's in the demo_customer360_db, the tables in the database must be listed.

--- CONSTRAINTS ---
- Permitted Tools for this Phase (You MUST use the exact argument names provided):

- Tool: `base_tableList`
  - Description: Lists all tables in a database.
  - Arguments:
    - `database_name` (string, required): Database Name

- Previous Attempt (if any): None

--- WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY ---
- Actions Taken So Far: []
- Data Collected So Far: {}


--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection & Arguments)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool. Furthermore, you **MUST** use the exact argument names as they are defined in the tool details above. You **MUST NOT** invent, hallucinate, or use any arguments that are not explicitly listed in the definitions.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If you are in a looping phase (indicated by the presence of a "LOOP CONTEXT" section), you **MUST** focus your action on the single item provided in `current_loop_item`. You **MUST** use the information within that item to formulate the arguments for your tool call.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.


USER PROMPT:
Determine the next action based on the instructions and state provided in the system prompt.
[model]: ```json
{"tool_name": "base_tableList", "arguments": {"database_name": "demo_customer360_db"}}
```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prompt First for Defined Workflows:** If the user's request is a strong semantic match for the description of an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts represent pre-defined, multi-step workflows and are the preferred method for common, complex tasks.
2.  **Tools for Direct Actions:** If no prompt is a direct match, analyze the request for a direct action or analysis. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action. Prioritize tools that use the most specific entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned).

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about data quality, but it's not a broad request for a "description". No prompt is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: select a tool for a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is a "business description". I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
give me the business description of Equipment

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): give me the business description of Equipment
- Workflow History (Actions taken so far): []
- Known Entities (Key information discovered so far): {
  "database_name": "demo_customer360_db",
  "table_name": "CallCenter"
}
- Current Execution Depth: 0 (Max is 5)

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal and Context**: Carefully read the "GOAL" and review the "CONTEXT" section to understand the user's full intent and what has already been established.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Contextual Prioritization):** You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in `Known Entities`. The `Known Entities` memory is only for supplementing the `GOAL` (e.g., filling in a missing `database_name`), not for overriding it.

    **Example of Correct Prioritization:**
    * If the `GOAL` is "analyze quality of **'equipment'**".
    * And `Known Entities` contains `{"table_name": "CallCenter"}`.
    * You **MUST** create a plan to analyze the **"equipment"** table. You **MUST NOT** use the stale "CallCenter" entity from memory.
3.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
4.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase.
    -   To specify the action, you MUST use ONE of the following keys:
        -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of `(tool)` names permitted for this phase.
        -   `"executable_prompt"`: The name of a single `(prompt)` to execute for this phase.
    -   (Optional) `"arguments"`: If executing a prompt, provide any known arguments for it here.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
5.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
6.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process that requires a final summary or a specifically formatted report, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase. This phase **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool. Crucially, the `task_description` for this `CoreLLMTask` **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main "GOAL" itself. This ensures that all original context and formatting instructions are passed to the final synthesis step.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call or a single prompt execution, your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate capability. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action or a prompt execution. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You MUST NOT create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5, as this may cause an infinite loop. Also, if the "CONTEXT" section indicates you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again via `executable_prompt`.
10. **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.
11. **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested loops or structures. To handle requests that imply nested logic (e.g., "for each X, do Y for each Z"), you **MUST** decompose the task into multiple, sequential looping phases. The first phase gathers and flattens all the items from the nested level, and subsequent phases iterate over that single flattened list.

--- EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic) ---
- **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
- **Thought Process**: This requires a nested loop (databases -> tables). I must flatten this into two sequential phases.
- **Correct Plan**:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "First, get a list of all databases. Then, loop over each database to get its tables, collecting all table names into a single flat list for the next phase.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_0",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Now, loop over the flattened list of table names gathered in Phase 1 and get the DDL for each one.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

[model]: ```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Determine the database name for the table 'Equipment'.",
    "relevant_tools": [
      "base_columnDescription"
    ]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Now that the database for table 'Equipment' is known, get the business description of the table 'Equipment'.",
    "executable_prompt": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
    "arguments": {
      "table_name": "Equipment"
    }
  }
]
```

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are a tactical assistant executing a single phase of a larger plan. Your task is to decide the single best next action to take to achieve the current phase's goal, strictly adhering to the provided tool constraints.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
give me the business description of Equipment

--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
Determine the database name for the table 'Equipment'.

--- CONSTRAINTS ---
- Permitted Tools for this Phase (You MUST use the exact argument names provided):

- Tool: `base_columnDescription`
  - Description: Shows detailed column information about a database table via SQLAlchemy, bind parameters if provided (prepared SQL), and return the fully rendered SQL (with literals) in metadata.
  - Arguments:
    - `database_name` (string, required): Database name
    - `obj_name` (string, required): table or view name

- Previous Attempt (if any): None

--- WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY ---
- Actions Taken So Far: []
- Data Collected So Far: {}


--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection & Arguments)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool. Furthermore, you **MUST** use the exact argument names as they are defined in the tool details above. You **MUST NOT** invent, hallucinate, or use any arguments that are not explicitly listed in the definitions.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If you are in a looping phase (indicated by the presence of a "LOOP CONTEXT" section), you **MUST** focus your action on the single item provided in `current_loop_item`. You **MUST** use the information within that item to formulate the arguments for your tool call.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.

[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prompt First for Defined Workflows:** If the user's request is a strong semantic match for the description of an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts represent pre-defined, multi-step workflows and are the preferred method for common, complex tasks.
2.  **Tools for Direct Actions:** If no prompt is a direct match, analyze the request for a direct action or analysis. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action. Prioritize tools that use the most specific entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned).

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about data quality, but it's not a broad request for a "description". No prompt is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: select a tool for a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is a "business description". I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): how many databases are on the system?
- Workflow History (Actions taken so far): []
- Known Entities (Key information discovered so far): {}
- Current Execution Depth: 0 (Max is 5)

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal and Context**: Carefully read the "GOAL" and review the "CONTEXT" section to understand the user's full intent and what has already been established.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Contextual Prioritization):** You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in `Known Entities`. The `Known Entities` memory is only for supplementing the `GOAL` (e.g., filling in a missing `database_name`), not for overriding it.

    **Example of Correct Prioritization:**
    * If the `GOAL` is "analyze quality of **'equipment'**".
    * And `Known Entities` contains `{"table_name": "CallCenter"}`.
    * You **MUST** create a plan to analyze the **"equipment"** table. You **MUST NOT** use the stale "CallCenter" entity from memory.
3.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
4.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase.
    -   To specify the action, you MUST use ONE of the following keys:
        -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of `(tool)` names permitted for this phase.
        -   `"executable_prompt"`: The name of a single `(prompt)` to execute for this phase.
    -   (Optional) `"arguments"`: If executing a prompt, provide any known arguments for it here.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
5.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
6.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process that requires a final summary or a specifically formatted report, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase. This phase **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool. Crucially, the `task_description` for this `CoreLLMTask` **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main "GOAL" itself. This ensures that all original context and formatting instructions are passed to the final synthesis step.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call or a single prompt execution, your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate capability. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action or a prompt execution. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You MUST NOT create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5, as this may cause an infinite loop. Also, if the "CONTEXT" section indicates you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again via `executable_prompt`.
10. **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.
11. **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested loops or structures. To handle requests that imply nested logic (e.g., "for each X, do Y for each Z"), you **MUST** decompose the task into multiple, sequential looping phases. The first phase gathers and flattens all the items from the nested level, and subsequent phases iterate over that single flattened list.

--- EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic) ---
- **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
- **Thought Process**: This requires a nested loop (databases -> tables). I must flatten this into two sequential phases.
- **Correct Plan**:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "First, get a list of all databases. Then, loop over each database to get its tables, collecting all table names into a single flat list for the next phase.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_0",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Now, loop over the flattened list of table names gathered in Phase 1 and get the DDL for each one.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

[model]: ```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Determine how many databases are on the system by listing all databases.",
    "relevant_tools": [
      "base_databaseList"
    ]
  }
]
```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are a tactical assistant executing a single phase of a larger plan. Your task is to decide the single best next action to take to achieve the current phase's goal, strictly adhering to the provided tool constraints.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
Determine how many databases are on the system by listing all databases.

--- CONSTRAINTS ---
- Permitted Tools for this Phase (You MUST use the exact argument names provided):

- Tool: `base_databaseList`
  - Description: Lists all databases in the Teradata System.

- Previous Attempt (if any): None

--- WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY ---
- Actions Taken So Far: []
- Data Collected So Far: {}


--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection & Arguments)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool. Furthermore, you **MUST** use the exact argument names as they are defined in the tool details above. You **MUST NOT** invent, hallucinate, or use any arguments that are not explicitly listed in the definitions.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If you are in a looping phase (indicated by the presence of a "LOOP CONTEXT" section), you **MUST** focus your action on the single item provided in `current_loop_item`. You **MUST** use the information within that item to formulate the arguments for your tool call.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.


USER PROMPT:
Determine the next action based on the instructions and state provided in the system prompt.
[model]: ```json
{"tool_name": "base_databaseList", "arguments": {}}
```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prompt First for Defined Workflows:** If the user's request is a strong semantic match for the description of an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts represent pre-defined, multi-step workflows and are the preferred method for common, complex tasks.
2.  **Tools for Direct Actions:** If no prompt is a direct match, analyze the request for a direct action or analysis. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action. Prioritize tools that use the most specific entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned).

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about data quality, but it's not a broad request for a "description". No prompt is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: select a tool for a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is a "business description". I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
what's in demo_customer360_db?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): what's in demo_customer360_db?
- Workflow History (Actions taken so far): []
- Known Entities (Key information discovered so far): {
  "database_name": "SYSUIF"
}
- Current Execution Depth: 0 (Max is 5)

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal and Context**: Carefully read the "GOAL" and review the "CONTEXT" section to understand the user's full intent and what has already been established.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Contextual Prioritization):** You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in `Known Entities`. The `Known Entities` memory is only for supplementing the `GOAL` (e.g., filling in a missing `database_name`), not for overriding it.

    **Example of Correct Prioritization:**
    * If the `GOAL` is "analyze quality of **'equipment'**".
    * And `Known Entities` contains `{"table_name": "CallCenter"}`.
    * You **MUST** create a plan to analyze the **"equipment"** table. You **MUST NOT** use the stale "CallCenter" entity from memory.
3.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
4.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase.
    -   To specify the action, you MUST use ONE of the following keys:
        -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of `(tool)` names permitted for this phase.
        -   `"executable_prompt"`: The name of a single `(prompt)` to execute for this phase.
    -   (Optional) `"arguments"`: If executing a prompt, provide any known arguments for it here.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
5.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
6.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process that requires a final summary or a specifically formatted report, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase. This phase **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool. Crucially, the `task_description` for this `CoreLLMTask` **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main "GOAL" itself. This ensures that all original context and formatting instructions are passed to the final synthesis step.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call or a single prompt execution, your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate capability. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action or a prompt execution. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You MUST NOT create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5, as this may cause an infinite loop. Also, if the "CONTEXT" section indicates you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again via `executable_prompt`.
10. **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.
11. **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested loops or structures. To handle requests that imply nested logic (e.g., "for each X, do Y for each Z"), you **MUST** decompose the task into multiple, sequential looping phases. The first phase gathers and flattens all the items from the nested level, and subsequent phases iterate over that single flattened list.

--- EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic) ---
- **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
- **Thought Process**: This requires a nested loop (databases -> tables). I must flatten this into two sequential phases.
- **Correct Plan**:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "First, get a list of all databases. Then, loop over each database to get its tables, collecting all table names into a single flat list for the next phase.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_0",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Now, loop over the flattened list of table names gathered in Phase 1 and get the DDL for each one.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

[model]: ```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "To determine what's in the demo_customer360_db, the tables in the database must be listed.",

      "base_tableList"
    ],
    "arguments": {
      "database_name": "demo_customer360_db"
    }
  }
]
```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are a tactical assistant executing a single phase of a larger plan. Your task is to decide the single best next action to take to achieve the current phase's goal, strictly adhering to the provided tool constraints.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
what's in demo_customer360_db?

--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
To determine what's in the demo_customer360_db, the tables in the database must be listed.

--- CONSTRAINTS ---
- Permitted Tools for this Phase (You MUST use the exact argument names provided):

- Tool: `base_tableList`

  - Arguments:
    - `database_name` (string, required): Database Name

- Previous Attempt (if any): None

--- WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY ---
- Actions Taken So Far: []
- Data Collected So Far: {}


--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection & Arguments)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool. Furthermore, you **MUST** use the exact argument names as they are defined in the tool details above. You **MUST NOT** invent, hallucinate, or use any arguments that are not explicitly listed in the definitions.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If you are in a looping phase (indicated by the presence of a "LOOP CONTEXT" section), you **MUST** focus your action on the single item provided in `current_loop_item`. You **MUST** use the information within that item to formulate the arguments for your tool call.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.


USER PROMPT:
Determine the next action based on the instructions and state provided in the system prompt.

{"tool_name": "base_tableList", "arguments": {"database_name": "demo_customer360_db"}}
```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Follow this strict hierarchy for capability selection:**
1.  **Prompt First for Defined Workflows:** If the user's request is a strong semantic match for the description of an available `prompt`, you **MUST** select that `prompt_name`. Prompts represent pre-defined, multi-step workflows and are the preferred method for common, complex tasks.
2.  **Tools for Direct Actions:** If no prompt is a direct match, analyze the request for a direct action or analysis. Select the most specific `tool_name` that fulfills this action. Prioritize tools that use the most specific entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned).

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is about data quality, but it's not a broad request for a "description". No prompt is a perfect match.
    2. Therefore, I move to step 2 of my critical rule: select a tool for a direct action.
    3. The user's query is about a **table**. I must choose a table-level tool.
    4. The `qlty_columnSummary` tool takes a `table_name` and is the most specific, correct choice.
- **Correct Response:** `{"tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online"}}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1. The user's request is a "business description". I will check for a matching prompt first.
    2. The `base_databaseBusinessDesc` prompt is described as being for this exact purpose. It is a strong semantic match.
    3. According to my critical rule, I **MUST** select this prompt.
- **Correct Response:** `{"prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
give me the business description of Equipment

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): give me the business description of Equipment
- Workflow History (Actions taken so far): []
- Known Entities (Key information discovered so far): {
  "database_name": "demo_customer360_db",
  "table_name": "CallCenter"
}
- Current Execution Depth: 0 (Max is 5)

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal and Context**: Carefully read the "GOAL" and review the "CONTEXT" section to understand the user's full intent and what has already been established.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Contextual Prioritization):** You **MUST** prioritize entities from the user's current `GOAL` over conflicting information in `Known Entities`. The `Known Entities` memory is only for supplementing the `GOAL` (e.g., filling in a missing `database_name`), not for overriding it.

    **Example of Correct Prioritization:**
    * If the `GOAL` is "analyze quality of **'equipment'**".
    * And `Known Entities` contains `{"table_name": "CallCenter"}`.
    * You **MUST** create a plan to analyze the **"equipment"** table. You **MUST NOT** use the stale "CallCenter" entity from memory.
3.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
4.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase.
    -   To specify the action, you MUST use ONE of the following keys:
        -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of `(tool)` names permitted for this phase.
        -   `"executable_prompt"`: The name of a single `(prompt)` to execute for this phase.
    -   (Optional) `"arguments"`: If executing a prompt, provide any known arguments for it here.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
5.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
6.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process that requires a final summary or a specifically formatted report, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase. This phase **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool. Crucially, the `task_description` for this `CoreLLMTask` **MUST** be the complete and verbatim text of the main "GOAL" itself. This ensures that all original context and formatting instructions are passed to the final synthesis step.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call or a single prompt execution, your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate capability. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action or a prompt execution. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Recursion Prevention)**: Review the `Current Execution Depth`. You MUST NOT create a plan that calls an `executable_prompt` if the depth is approaching the maximum of 5, as this may cause an infinite loop. Also, if the "CONTEXT" section indicates you are already inside an `Active Prompt`, you **MUST NOT** create a plan that calls that same prompt again via `executable_prompt`.
10. **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.
11. **CRITICAL RULE (Plan Flattening)**: Your plan **MUST ALWAYS** be a flat, sequential list of phases. You **MUST NOT** create nested loops or structures. To handle requests that imply nested logic (e.g., "for each X, do Y for each Z"), you **MUST** decompose the task into multiple, sequential looping phases. The first phase gathers and flattens all the items from the nested level, and subsequent phases iterate over that single flattened list.

--- EXAMPLE (Flattening Nested Logic) ---
- **User Goal**: "For each database on the system, get the DDL for all of its tables."
- **Thought Process**: This requires a nested loop (databases -> tables). I must flatten this into two sequential phases.
- **Correct Plan**:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "First, get a list of all databases. Then, loop over each database to get its tables, collecting all table names into a single flat list for the next phase.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_0",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_listTables"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Now, loop over the flattened list of table names gathered in Phase 1 and get the DDL for each one.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

[model]: ```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Determine the database name for the table 'Equipment'.",
    "relevant_tools": [

    ]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Now that the database for table 'Equipment' is known, get the business description of the table 'Equipment'.",
    "executable_prompt": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
    "arguments": {
      "table_name": "Equipment"
    }
  }
]

  - Description: Shows detailed column information about a database table via SQLAlchemy, bind parameters if provided (prepared SQL), and return the fully rendered SQL (with literals) in metadata.
  - Arguments:
    - `database_name` (string, required): Database name
    - `obj_name` (string, required): table or view name

- Previous Attempt (if any): None

--- WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY ---
- Actions Taken So Far: []
- Data Collected So Far: {}


--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection & Arguments)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool. Furthermore, you **MUST** use the exact argument names as they are defined in the tool details above. You **MUST NOT** invent, hallucinate, or use any arguments that are not explicitly listed in the definitions.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If you are in a looping phase (indicated by the presence of a "LOOP CONTEXT" section), you **MUST** focus your action on the single item provided in `current_loop_item`. You **MUST** use the information within that item to formulate the arguments for your tool call.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.
