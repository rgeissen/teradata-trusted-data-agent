Generating a strategic meta-plan for the 'base_tableBusinessDesc' workflow.

--- History ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a complex, multi-step user request and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a roadmap for a state machine executor.

--- MASTER PROMPT (The User's Goal) ---
You are a Teradata DBA who is an expert in describing the business use of tables in a database.

## your role will work through the phases
Perform the phases in order, and do not skip any phase.

## Phase 0 - Get the table name and database name
- The table name is equipment
- The database name is DEMO_Customer360_db

## Phase 1 - Get the table DDL
- Get the table DDL from the user. The DDL should be a single string, and it should not contain any new lines or special characters. Use the base_tableDDL tool to get the DDL.

## Phase 2 - Describe the table
- Describe the table in a business context. The description should be a single string. 
- The description should include the following: 
    - The purpose of the table
    - The purpose of the columns in the table

## Communication guidelines:
      - Be concise but informative in your explanations
      - Clearly indicate which phase the process is currently in
      - summarize the outcome of the phase before moving to the next phase

## Final output guidelines:
      - return in markdown
      - Example:
      ***Table Name:*** `table_name`

      ***Database Name:*** `database_name`

      ***Description:*** `table_description`

         - ***Column1:*** `column1_descriptions`
         - ***Column2:*** `column2_descriptions`
         - ***Column3:*** `column3_descriptions`


--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question: Manual execution of prompt: base_tableBusinessDesc

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Master Prompt**: Carefully read the entire "MASTER PROMPT" to identify the distinct phases, steps, and communication requirements.
2.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step in the process.
3.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase. This goal will guide a separate, tactical LLM.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
4.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the "MASTER PROMPT" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
5.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: Your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase that handles both the synthesis of the final report AND its formatting. The goal for this last phase **MUST** explicitly state all description requirements AND all formatting guidelines from the master prompt. Do not create separate phases for describing and formatting.
6.  **CRITICAL RULE**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action described in the Master Prompt (e.g., "Get the table DDL," "Describe the table"). You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information (e.g., "Acknowledge the table name"). Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.

--- EXAMPLE ---
If the master prompt requires getting DDL and then describing/formatting, your output should be a two-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the DDL for the table 'customers' in database 'sales' using the `base_tableDDL` tool."
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Synthesize a final report by describing the 'customers' table in a business context and format the output as markdown according to the Final output guidelines, using `***` for keys."
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.


USER PROMPT:

- Get the table DDL from the user. The DDL should be a single string, and it should not contain any new lines or special characters. Use the base_tableDDL tool to get the DDL.

## Phase 2 - Describe the table
- Describe the table in a business context. The description should be a single string. 
- The description should include the following: 
    - The purpose of the table
    - The purpose of the columns in the table

## Communication guidelines:
      - Be concise but informative in your explanations
      - Clearly indicate which phase the process is currently in
      - summarize the outcome of the phase before moving to the next phase

## Final output guidelines:
      - return in markdown
      - Example:
      ***Table Name:*** `table_name`

      ***Database Name:*** `database_name`

      ***Description:*** `table_description`

         - ***Column1:*** `column1_descriptions`
         - ***Column2:*** `column2_descriptions`
         - ***Column3:*** `column3_descriptions`


--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question: Manual execution of prompt: base_tableBusinessDesc

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Master Prompt**: Carefully read the entire "MASTER PROMPT" to identify the distinct phases, steps, and communication requirements.
2.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step in the process.
3.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase. This goal will guide a separate, tactical LLM.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
4.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the "MASTER PROMPT" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
5.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: Your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase that handles both the synthesis of the final report AND its formatting. The goal for this last phase **MUST** explicitly state all description requirements AND all formatting guidelines from the master prompt. Do not create separate phases for describing and formatting.
6.  **CRITICAL RULE**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action described in the Master Prompt (e.g., "Get the table DDL," "Describe the table"). You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information (e.g., "Acknowledge the table name"). Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.

--- EXAMPLE ---
If the master prompt requires getting DDL and then describing/formatting, your output should be a two-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the DDL for the table 'customers' in database 'sales' using the `base_tableDDL` tool."
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Synthesize a final report by describing the 'customers' table in a business context and format the output as markdown according to the Final output guidelines, using `***` for keys."
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.


USER PROMPT:

  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Describe the 'equipment' table in the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database in a business context, including the purpose of the table and the purpose of the columns in the table. Then, synthesize a final report and format the output as markdown, including the table name, database name, description of the table, and a description of each column. The markdown should use the following format: ***Table Name:*** `table_name`, ***Database Name:*** `database_name`, ***Description:*** `table_description`, followed by a list of columns with the format: - ***Column1:*** `column1_descriptions`, - ***Column2:*** `column2_descriptions`, etc."

--- MASTER PROMPT (The User's Goal) ---
You are a Teradata DBA who is an expert in describing the business use of tables in a database.

## your role will work through the phases
Perform the phases in order, and do not skip any phase.

## Phase 0 - Get the table name and database name
- The table name is equipment
- The database name is DEMO_Customer360_db

## Phase 1 - Get the table DDL
- Get the table DDL from the user. The DDL should be a single string, and it should not contain any new lines or special characters. Use the base_tableDDL tool to get the DDL.

## Phase 2 - Describe the table
- Describe the table in a business context. The description should be a single string. 
- The description should include the following: 
    - The purpose of the table
    - The purpose of the columns in the table

## Communication guidelines:
      - Be concise but informative in your explanations
      - Clearly indicate which phase the process is currently in

         - ***Column3:*** `column3_descriptions`


--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question: Manual execution of prompt: base_tableBusinessDesc

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Master Prompt**: Carefully read the entire "MASTER PROMPT" to identify the distinct phases, steps, and communication requirements.
2.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step in the process.
3.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase. This goal will guide a separate, tactical LLM.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
4.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the "MASTER PROMPT" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
5.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: Your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase that handles both the synthesis of the final report AND its formatting. The goal for this last phase **MUST** explicitly state all description requirements AND all formatting guidelines from the master prompt. Do not create separate phases for describing and formatting.
6.  **CRITICAL RULE**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action described in the Master Prompt (e.g., "Get the table DDL," "Describe the table"). You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information (e.g., "Acknowledge the table name"). Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.

--- EXAMPLE ---
If the master prompt requires getting DDL and then describing/formatting, your output should be a two-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the DDL for the table 'customers' in database 'sales' using the `base_tableDDL` tool."

- Get the table DDL from the user. The DDL should be a single string, and it should not contain any new lines or special characters. Use the base_tableDDL tool to get the DDL.

## Phase 2 - Describe the table
- Describe the table in a business context. The description should be a single string. 
- The description should include the following: 
    - The purpose of the table
    - The purpose of the columns in the table

## Communication guidelines:
      - Be concise but informative in your explanations
      - Clearly indicate which phase the process is currently in
      - summarize the outcome of the phase before moving to the next phase

## Final output guidelines:
      - return in markdown
      - Example:
      ***Table Name:*** `table_name`

      ***Database Name:*** `database_name`

      ***Description:*** `table_description`

         - ***Column1:*** `column1_descriptions`
         - ***Column2:*** `column2_descriptions`
         - ***Column3:*** `column3_descriptions`


--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
Get the table DDL for the table 'equipment' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db' using the base_tableDDL tool.

- Data Collected So Far: {}

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **Decide Next Action**: Based on your analysis, determine the single best tool to call next to make progress on the current phase's goal.
3.  **CRITICAL RULE (CoreLLMTask Usage)**:
    -   You **MUST** select from the list of available **TOOLS ONLY**. You are not allowed to call a prompt.
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument (e.g., `"source_data": ["result_of_phase_1"]` or `"source_data": ["result_of_phase_0", "result_of_phase_2"]`).
4.  **Handle Loops**: If the current phase involves a loop (e.g., "for each table"), identify the next item in the sequence that has not yet been processed and select the appropriate action for that single item.
5.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.
