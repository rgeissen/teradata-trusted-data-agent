2025-08-05 17:26:20,018 - --- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}}
}}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db"}}
}}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- After successfully gathering data with Teradata tools, consider if a visualization would enhance the answer.
- Use a chart tool if it provides a clear summary (e.g., bar chart for space usage, pie chart for distributions).
- Do not generate charts for simple data retrievals that are easily readable in a table.
- When you use a chart tool, tell the user in your final answer what the chart represents.

--- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 9c04f9b6-69ac-4735-8154-d65000cde478) ---
[user]: What is the quality of database DEMO_Customer360_db?
[assistant]: ```json
{
  "prompt_name": "qlty_databaseQuality",
  "arguments": {
    "database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"
  }
}
```
[user]: You are a data analyst. Your task is to provide a natural language business description based on a table's DDL.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Your entire response MUST be plain text.
2. DO NOT generate JSON, tool calls, or any code.

--- DDL to Analyze ---
```sql
CREATE MULTISET TABLE DEMO_Customer360_db.CallCenter ,FALLBACK ,     NO BEFORE JOURNAL,     NO AFTER JOURNAL,     CHECKSUM = DEFAULT,     DEFAULT MERGEBLOCKRATIO,     MAP = TD_MAP1     (      GENDER VARCHAR(1) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      FIRST_NAME VARCHAR(10) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      LAST_NAME VARCHAR(9) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      ADDRESS VARCHAR(25) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      STATE VARCHAR(2) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      CITY VARCHAR(16) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      ZIPCODE INTEGER,      PHONE VARCHAR(14) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      CALL_CENTER_COST BYTEINT)NO PRIMARY INDEX ;
```

2025-08-05 17:26:22,340 - --- RESPONSE ---
The CallCenter table within the DEMO_Customer360_db database is designed to store detailed information about call center representatives. It includes fields for the representative's gender, first name, last name, address, state, city, zip code, and phone number. Additionally, it records the cost associated with the call center, presumably per representative or per call. This table does not have a primary index, indicating that it may be used for non-unique data storage or as a staging table. The data is stored in a multiset table, allowing for duplicate rows, and utilizes the Latin character set with case-specific storage for text fields.
--------------------------------------------------

2025-08-05 17:26:23,513 - --- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are a JSON-only responding assistant.

--- FULL CONTEXT (Session: one-off) ---
[user]: You are a tool analyzer. Based on the tool's name and description, determine if its `col_name` argument is intended for 'numeric' types, 'character' types, or 'any' type. The tool's capabilities are:
Tool Name: `qlty_univariateStatistics`
Tool Description: "
    Get the univariate statistics for a table.

    Arguments:
      database_name - name of the database
      table_name - table name to analyze
      col_name - column name to analyze

    Returns:
      ResponseType: formatted response with query results + metadata
    "

Contextual Hint: This tool is intended for quantitative analysis. When `col_name` is an argument, it requires a 'numeric' data type.

Respond with a single, raw JSON object with one key, 'dataType', and the value 'numeric', 'character', or 'any'.
Example response for a statistical tool: {{"dataType": "numeric"}}

2025-08-05 17:26:23,513 - --- RESPONSE ---
{
  "dataType": "numeric"
}
--------------------------------------------------

2025-08-05 17:26:26,381 - --- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}}
}}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db"}}
}}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- After successfully gathering data with Teradata tools, consider if a visualization would enhance the answer.
- Use a chart tool if it provides a clear summary (e.g., bar chart for space usage, pie chart for distributions).
- Do not generate charts for simple data retrievals that are easily readable in a table.
- When you use a chart tool, tell the user in your final answer what the chart represents.

--- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 9c04f9b6-69ac-4735-8154-d65000cde478) ---
[user]: What is the quality of database DEMO_Customer360_db?
[assistant]: ```json
{
  "prompt_name": "qlty_databaseQuality",
  "arguments": {
    "database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"
  }
}
```
[user]: You are a data analyst. Your task is to provide a natural language business description based on a table's DDL.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Your entire response MUST be plain text.
2. DO NOT generate JSON, tool calls, or any code.

--- DDL to Analyze ---
```sql
CREATE MULTISET TABLE DEMO_Customer360_db.Equipment ,FALLBACK ,     NO BEFORE JOURNAL,     NO AFTER JOURNAL,     CHECKSUM = DEFAULT,     DEFAULT MERGEBLOCKRATIO,     MAP = TD_MAP1     (      CUST_ID SMALLINT,      GENDER VARCHAR(1) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      FIRSTNAME VARCHAR(11) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      LASTNAME VARCHAR(9) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      ADDRESS VARCHAR(25) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      STATE VARCHAR(2) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      CITY VARCHAR(16) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      ZIP INTEGER,      EQUIP_LTV SMALLINT)NO PRIMARY INDEX ;
```

2025-08-05 17:26:26,381 - --- RESPONSE ---
The Equipment table in the DEMO_Customer360_db database is designed to store detailed information about customer equipment. It includes fields for customer identification (CUST_ID), gender (GENDER), first name (FIRSTNAME), last name (LASTNAME), address (ADDRESS), state (STATE), city (CITY), ZIP code (ZIP), and equipment loan-to-value ratio (EQUIP_LTV). This table is structured as a multiset table, allowing for duplicate rows, and does not have a primary index. It is configured with default settings for checksum and merge block ratio, and uses the TD_MAP1 map. This table is intended for storing customer equipment data without enforcing unique records, making it suitable for scenarios where duplicate entries are expected or allowed.
--------------------------------------------------

2025-08-05 17:26:29,863 - --- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}}
}}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db"}}
}}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- After successfully gathering data with Teradata tools, consider if a visualization would enhance the answer.
- Use a chart tool if it provides a clear summary (e.g., bar chart for space usage, pie chart for distributions).
- Do not generate charts for simple data retrievals that are easily readable in a table.
- When you use a chart tool, tell the user in your final answer what the chart represents.

--- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 9c04f9b6-69ac-4735-8154-d65000cde478) ---
[user]: What is the quality of database DEMO_Customer360_db?
[assistant]: ```json
{
  "prompt_name": "qlty_databaseQuality",
  "arguments": {
    "database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"
  }
}
```
[user]: You are a data analyst. Your task is to provide a natural language business description based on a table's DDL.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Your entire response MUST be plain text.
2. DO NOT generate JSON, tool calls, or any code.

--- DDL to Analyze ---
```sql
CREATE MULTISET TABLE DEMO_Customer360_db.Online ,FALLBACK ,     NO BEFORE JOURNAL,     NO AFTER JOURNAL,     CHECKSUM = DEFAULT,     DEFAULT MERGEBLOCKRATIO,     MAP = TD_MAP1     (      LOYALTY_NUM INTEGER,      SEX VARCHAR(1) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      FNAME VARCHAR(11) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      LNAME VARCHAR(9) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      ADDR VARCHAR(25) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      STATE VARCHAR(2) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      CITY VARCHAR(16) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      ZIP INTEGER,      EMAIL VARCHAR(31) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      ONLINE_LTV SMALLINT)NO PRIMARY INDEX ;
```

2025-08-05 17:26:29,863 - --- RESPONSE ---
The table "Online" in the "DEMO_Customer360_db" database is designed to store customer information related to online activities. It includes fields for a loyalty number, sex, first name, last name, address, state, city, zip code, email, and online lifetime value (LTV). The table is set up as a multiset, meaning it can contain duplicate rows. It has no primary index, which may affect query performance for large datasets. The table is configured with default settings for checksum and merge block ratio, and it uses the TD_MAP1 map. This table is useful for analyzing customer demographics and online behavior, as well as calculating the value customers bring to the business through their online interactions.
--------------------------------------------------

2025-08-05 17:26:33,401 - --- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}}
}}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db"}}
}}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- After successfully gathering data with Teradata tools, consider if a visualization would enhance the answer.
- Use a chart tool if it provides a clear summary (e.g., bar chart for space usage, pie chart for distributions).
- Do not generate charts for simple data retrievals that are easily readable in a table.
- When you use a chart tool, tell the user in your final answer what the chart represents.

--- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 9c04f9b6-69ac-4735-8154-d65000cde478) ---
[user]: What is the quality of database DEMO_Customer360_db?
[assistant]: ```json
{
  "prompt_name": "qlty_databaseQuality",
  "arguments": {
    "database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"
  }
}
```
[user]: You are a data analyst. Your task is to provide a natural language business description based on a table's DDL.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Your entire response MUST be plain text.
2. DO NOT generate JSON, tool calls, or any code.

--- DDL to Analyze ---
```sql
CREATE MULTISET TABLE DEMO_Customer360_db.Cookie ,FALLBACK ,     NO BEFORE JOURNAL,     NO AFTER JOURNAL,     CHECKSUM = DEFAULT,     DEFAULT MERGEBLOCKRATIO,     MAP = TD_MAP1     (      ADDR_LN_1_TXT VARCHAR(25) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      ST_OR_PROV_CD VARCHAR(2) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      CITY_NAME VARCHAR(21) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      ZIP INTEGER,      COOKIE VARCHAR(32) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      CAMPAIGN VARCHAR(7) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC)NO PRIMARY INDEX ;
```

2025-08-05 17:26:33,402 - --- RESPONSE ---
The table "Cookie" in the "DEMO_Customer360_db" database is designed to store customer-related data, specifically focusing on cookie information associated with marketing campaigns. The table includes fields for the customer's address line 1 (ADDR_LN_1_TXT), state or province code (ST_OR_PROV_CD), city name (CITY_NAME), ZIP code (ZIP), a unique cookie identifier (COOKIE), and a campaign code (CAMPAIGN). This table is useful for tracking customer interactions and campaign effectiveness by correlating cookie data with geographic and campaign information. The absence of a primary index suggests that the table may be used for aggregations or as a staging table rather than for unique record identification.
--------------------------------------------------

2025-08-05 17:26:37,395 - --- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}}
}}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db"}}
}}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- After successfully gathering data with Teradata tools, consider if a visualization would enhance the answer.
- Use a chart tool if it provides a clear summary (e.g., bar chart for space usage, pie chart for distributions).
- Do not generate charts for simple data retrievals that are easily readable in a table.
- When you use a chart tool, tell the user in your final answer what the chart represents.

--- YOUR TASK ---
Your task is to generate a final report in a specific JSON format. Your response **MUST** be a single, raw JSON object containing two keys:
1. `"summary"`: A natural language summary that synthesizes the key findings from the COLLECTED DATA SUMMARY to answer the user's original request. This summary should be comprehensive and easy to understand.
2. `"structured_data"`: The original, full COLLECTED DATA, which will be passed through programmatically. You do not need to include it here.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object containing only the `"summary"` key and its value.
2. The `summary` should be based *only* on the data summary provided.
3. If you see results with a 'skipped' status in the data summary, you MUST mention this in your `summary`.
Example response: {"summary": "The data quality assessment for the database is complete. DDL was retrieved for three tables, and various quality checks were performed..."}

```json
{
  "summary": "The data quality assessment for the DEMO_Customer360_db database is complete. DDL was retrieved for four tables: CallCenter, Equipment, Online, and Cookie. Business descriptions were generated for each table. Column summaries were executed successfully for all tables, yielding 9 rows for CallCenter, 9 rows for Equipment, 10 rows for Online, and 6 rows for Cookie. Univariate statistics were calculated for all tables. The step to check for rows with missing values was skipped for all tables because previous steps confirmed that these tables have no null values."
