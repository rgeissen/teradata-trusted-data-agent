--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Generating a strategic meta-plan for the goal: 'how many databases are on the system?...'

--- History ---


--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): how many databases are on the system?

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal**: Carefully read the "GOAL" to understand the user's full intent.
2.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
3.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase. This goal will guide a separate, tactical LLM.
    -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of tool names that are permitted to be used during this phase. You MUST select the most appropriate and specific tools from the full "Capabilities" list provided in the main system prompt to achieve the phase's goal.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
4.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
5.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process with a final reporting requirement, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase that handles both the synthesis of the final report AND its formatting. The `relevant_tools` for this final phase **MUST** be `["CoreLLMTask"]`.
6.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call (e.g., "list all databases", "what is the system utilization?"), your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate tool. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Types)**: You are generating a plan of executable **tools**. The `relevant_tools` list **MUST ONLY** contain names of capabilities that are explicitly marked as `(tool)` in the system's "Capabilities" list. You **MUST NOT** include the name of any capability marked as `(prompt)`.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.

--- EXAMPLE (Complex Goal) ---
If the main goal requires getting DDL and then describing/formatting, your output should be a two-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the DDL for the table 'customers' in database 'sales' using the `base_tableDDL` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Synthesize a final report by describing the 'customers' table in a business context and format the output as markdown according to the Final output guidelines, using `***` for keys.",
    "relevant_tools": ["CoreLLMTask"]
  }
]
```

--- EXAMPLE (Simple Goal) ---
If the main goal is "what is the system utilization?", your output should be a single-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the system utilization using the `dba_resusageSummary` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["dba_resusageSummary"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Deciding next tactical action for phase: Get a list of all databases in the Teradata system using the `base_databaseList` tool.

--- History ---


--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are a tactical assistant executing a single phase of a larger plan. Your task is to decide the single best next action to take to achieve the current phase's goal, strictly adhering to the provided tool constraints.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
Get a list of all databases in the Teradata system using the `base_databaseList` tool.

--- CONSTRAINTS ---
- Permitted Tools for this Phase: ["base_databaseList"]
- Previous Attempt (if any): None

--- WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY ---
- Actions Taken So Far: []
- Data Collected So Far: {}

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If the current phase involves a loop (e.g., "for each table"), identify the next item in the sequence that has not yet been processed and select the appropriate action for that single item.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.

SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  Provide a holistic analysis and actionable insights.
2.  Begin with a high-level summary, then use bullet points for key observations.
3.  Your entire response **MUST** begin with `FINAL_ANSWER:`.


2025-08-21 14:40:15,382 - --- RESPONSE ---
FINAL_ANSWER: Based on the data collected, there are 50 databases on the Teradata system. These databases are divided into two types:

* 24 databases with DBType "DataBase" - These are system databases and application databases
* 26 databases with DBType "User" - These are user-specific databases

The list includes system databases like DBC, SYSLIB, and TD_SERVER_DB, as well as application databases like DEMO_Customer360_db and modelops. There are also several databases with "TDaaS" prefixes that appear to be related to Teradata as a Service functionality for operations like monitoring, maintenance, backup and restore.

--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Generating a strategic meta-plan for the goal: 'what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?...'

--- History ---


--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal**: Carefully read the "GOAL" to understand the user's full intent.
2.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
3.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase. This goal will guide a separate, tactical LLM.
    -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of tool names that are permitted to be used during this phase. You MUST select the most appropriate and specific tools from the full "Capabilities" list provided in the main system prompt to achieve the phase's goal.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
4.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
5.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process with a final reporting requirement, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase that handles both the synthesis of the final report AND its formatting. The `relevant_tools` for this final phase **MUST** be `["CoreLLMTask"]`.
6.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call (e.g., "list all databases", "what is the system utilization?"), your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate tool. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Types)**: You are generating a plan of executable **tools**. The `relevant_tools` list **MUST ONLY** contain names of capabilities that are explicitly marked as `(tool)` in the system's "Capabilities" list. You **MUST NOT** include the name of any capability marked as `(prompt)`.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.

--- EXAMPLE (Complex Goal) ---
If the main goal requires getting DDL and then describing/formatting, your output should be a two-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the DDL for the table 'customers' in database 'sales' using the `base_tableDDL` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Synthesize a final report by describing the 'customers' table in a business context and format the output as markdown according to the Final output guidelines, using `***` for keys.",
    "relevant_tools": ["CoreLLMTask"]
  }
]
```

--- EXAMPLE (Simple Goal) ---
If the main goal is "what is the system utilization?", your output should be a single-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the system utilization using the `dba_resusageSummary` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["dba_resusageSummary"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are a tactical assistant executing a single phase of a larger plan. Your task is to decide the single best next action to take to achieve the current phase's goal, strictly adhering to the provided tool constraints.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?

--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
Retrieve the list of tables in the DEMO_Customer360_db database using the base_tableList tool.

--- CONSTRAINTS ---
- Permitted Tools for this Phase: ["base_tableList"]
- Previous Attempt (if any): None

--- WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY ---
- Actions Taken So Far: []
- Data Collected So Far: {}

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If the current phase involves a loop (e.g., "for each table"), identify the next item in the sequence that has not yet been processed and select the appropriate action for that single item.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If the current phase involves a loop (e.g., "for each table"), identify the next item in the sequence that has not yet been processed and select the appropriate action for that single item.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.

--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Generating final summary from all collected tool data.

--- History ---


--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  Provide a holistic analysis and actionable insights.
2.  Begin with a high-level summary, then use bullet points for key observations.
3.  Your entire response **MUST** begin with `FINAL_ANSWER:`.


2025-08-21 14:40:47,484 - --- RESPONSE ---
FINAL_ANSWER: I found that the DEMO_Customer360_db database contains 2 tables:

• Equipment - This appears to be a table that likely contains data related to equipment or hardware inventory.
• CallCenter - This table likely contains information related to call center operations, possibly including call records, agent information, or customer service interactions.

These tables suggest that DEMO_Customer360_db is designed for customer service operations, potentially tracking customer interactions and equipment-related data as part of a customer 360 view solution.

To explore more details about each table's structure, you could use the base_columnDescription tool to examine their specific columns and data types.

You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
what's in CallCenter?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): what's in CallCenter?

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal**: Carefully read the "GOAL" to understand the user's full intent.
2.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
3.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase. This goal will guide a separate, tactical LLM.
    -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of tool names that are permitted to be used during this phase. You MUST select the most appropriate and specific tools from the full "Capabilities" list provided in the main system prompt to achieve the phase's goal.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
4.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
5.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process with a final reporting requirement, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase that handles both the synthesis of the final report AND its formatting. The `relevant_tools` for this final phase **MUST** be `["CoreLLMTask"]`.
6.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call (e.g., "list all databases", "what is the system utilization?"), your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate tool. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Types)**: You are generating a plan of executable **tools**. The `relevant_tools` list **MUST ONLY** contain names of capabilities that are explicitly marked as `(tool)` in the system's "Capabilities" list. You **MUST NOT** include the name of any capability marked as `(prompt)`.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.

--- EXAMPLE (Complex Goal) ---
If the main goal requires getting DDL and then describing/formatting, your output should be a two-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the DDL for the table 'customers' in database 'sales' using the `base_tableDDL` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Synthesize a final report by describing the 'customers' table in a business context and format the output as markdown according to the Final output guidelines, using `***` for keys.",
    "relevant_tools": ["CoreLLMTask"]
  }
]
```

--- EXAMPLE (Simple Goal) ---
If the main goal is "what is the system utilization?", your output should be a single-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the system utilization using the `dba_resusageSummary` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["dba_resusageSummary"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are a tactical assistant executing a single phase of a larger plan. Your task is to decide the single best next action to take to achieve the current phase's goal, strictly adhering to the provided tool constraints.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
what's in CallCenter?

--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
List all tables in the 'CallCenter' database to get an overview of its contents.

--- CONSTRAINTS ---
- Permitted Tools for this Phase: ["base_tableList"]
- Previous Attempt (if any): None

--- WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY ---
- Actions Taken So Far: []
- Data Collected So Far: {}

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If the current phase involves a loop (e.g., "for each table"), identify the next item in the sequence that has not yet been processed and select the appropriate action for that single item.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.
