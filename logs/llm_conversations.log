Generating a strategic meta-plan for the goal: 'how many databases are on the system?...'

--- History ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): how many databases are on the system?

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal**: Carefully read the "GOAL" to understand the user's full intent.
2.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
3.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase. This goal will guide a separate, tactical LLM.
    -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of tool names that are permitted to be used during this phase. You MUST select the most appropriate and specific tools from the full "Capabilities" list provided in the main system prompt to achieve the phase's goal.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
4.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
5.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process with a final reporting requirement, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase that handles both the synthesis of the final report AND its formatting. The `relevant_tools` for this final phase **MUST** be `["CoreLLMTask"]`.
6.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call (e.g., "list all databases", "what is the system utilization?"), your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate tool. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Types)**: You are generating a plan of executable **tools**. The `relevant_tools` list **MUST ONLY** contain names of capabilities that are explicitly marked as `(tool)` in the system's "Capabilities" list. You **MUST NOT** include the name of any capability marked as `(prompt)`.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.

--- EXAMPLE (Complex Goal) ---
If the main goal requires getting DDL and then describing/formatting, your output should be a two-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the DDL for the table 'customers' in database 'sales' using the `base_tableDDL` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Synthesize a final report by describing the 'customers' table in a business context and format the output as markdown according to the Final output guidelines, using `***` for keys.",
    "relevant_tools": ["CoreLLMTask"]
  }
]
```

--- EXAMPLE (Simple Goal) ---
If the main goal is "what is the system utilization?", your output should be a single-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the system utilization using the `dba_resusageSummary` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["dba_resusageSummary"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are a tactical assistant executing a single phase of a larger plan. Your task is to decide the single best next action to take to achieve the current phase's goal, strictly adhering to the provided tool constraints.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
Determine the number of databases on the system using the `list_databases` tool.

--- CONSTRAINTS ---
- Permitted Tools for this Phase: ["list_databases"]
- Previous Attempt (if any): None

--- WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY ---
- Actions Taken So Far: []
- Data Collected So Far: {}

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If the current phase involves a loop (e.g., "for each table"), identify the next item in the sequence that has not yet been processed and select the appropriate action for that single item.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.

    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If the current phase involves a loop (e.g., "for each table"), identify the next item in the sequence that has not yet been processed and select the appropriate action for that single item.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.

--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Checking for completion of phase: Determine the number of databases on the system using the `list_databases` tool.

--- History ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): how many databases are on the system?

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal**: Carefully read the "GOAL" to understand the user's full intent.
2.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
3.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase. This goal will guide a separate, tactical LLM.
    -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of tool names that are permitted to be used during this phase. You MUST select the most appropriate and specific tools from the full "Capabilities" list provided in the main system prompt to achieve the phase's goal.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
4.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
5.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process with a final reporting requirement, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase that handles both the synthesis of the final report AND its formatting. The `relevant_tools` for this final phase **MUST** be `["CoreLLMTask"]`.
6.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call (e.g., "list all databases", "what is the system utilization?"), your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate tool. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Types)**: You are generating a plan of executable **tools**. The `relevant_tools` list **MUST ONLY** contain names of capabilities that are explicitly marked as `(tool)` in the system's "Capabilities" list. You **MUST NOT** include the name of any capability marked as `(prompt)`.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.

--- EXAMPLE (Complex Goal) ---
If the main goal requires getting DDL and then describing/formatting, your output should be a two-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the DDL for the table 'customers' in database 'sales' using the `base_tableDDL` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Synthesize a final report by describing the 'customers' table in a business context and format the output as markdown according to the Final output guidelines, using `***` for keys.",
    "relevant_tools": ["CoreLLMTask"]
  }
]
```

--- EXAMPLE (Simple Goal) ---
If the main goal is "what is the system utilization?", your output should be a single-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the system utilization using the `dba_resusageSummary` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["dba_resusageSummary"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If the current phase involves a loop (e.g., "for each table"), identify the next item in the sequence that has not yet been processed and select the appropriate action for that single item.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.

--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Checking for completion of phase: Determine the number of databases on the system using the `list_databases` tool.

--- History ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): how many databases are on the system?

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal**: Carefully read the "GOAL" to understand the user's full intent.
2.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
3.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase. This goal will guide a separate, tactical LLM.
    -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of tool names that are permitted to be used during this phase. You MUST select the most appropriate and specific tools from the full "Capabilities" list provided in the main system prompt to achieve the phase's goal.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
4.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
5.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process with a final reporting requirement, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase that handles both the synthesis of the final report AND its formatting. The `relevant_tools` for this final phase **MUST** be `["CoreLLMTask"]`.
6.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call (e.g., "list all databases", "what is the system utilization?"), your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate tool. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Types)**: You are generating a plan of executable **tools**. The `relevant_tools` list **MUST ONLY** contain names of capabilities that are explicitly marked as `(tool)` in the system's "Capabilities" list. You **MUST NOT** include the name of any capability marked as `(prompt)`.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.

--- EXAMPLE (Complex Goal) ---
If the main goal requires getting DDL and then describing/formatting, your output should be a two-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the DDL for the table 'customers' in database 'sales' using the `base_tableDDL` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Synthesize a final report by describing the 'customers' table in a business context and format the output as markdown according to the Final output guidelines, using `***` for keys.",
    "relevant_tools": ["CoreLLMTask"]
  }
]
```

--- EXAMPLE (Simple Goal) ---
If the main goal is "what is the system utilization?", your output should be a single-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the system utilization using the `dba_resusageSummary` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["dba_resusageSummary"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Deciding next tactical action for phase: Determine the number of databases on the system using the `list_databases` tool.

--- History ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): how many databases are on the system?

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal**: Carefully read the "GOAL" to understand the user's full intent.
2.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
3.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase. This goal will guide a separate, tactical LLM.
    -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of tool names that are permitted to be used during this phase. You MUST select the most appropriate and specific tools from the full "Capabilities" list provided in the main system prompt to achieve the phase's goal.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
4.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
5.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process with a final reporting requirement, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase that handles both the synthesis of the final report AND its formatting. The `relevant_tools` for this final phase **MUST** be `["CoreLLMTask"]`.
6.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call (e.g., "list all databases", "what is the system utilization?"), your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate tool. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Types)**: You are generating a plan of executable **tools**. The `relevant_tools` list **MUST ONLY** contain names of capabilities that are explicitly marked as `(tool)` in the system's "Capabilities" list. You **MUST NOT** include the name of any capability marked as `(prompt)`.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.

--- EXAMPLE (Complex Goal) ---
If the main goal requires getting DDL and then describing/formatting, your output should be a two-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the DDL for the table 'customers' in database 'sales' using the `base_tableDDL` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Synthesize a final report by describing the 'customers' table in a business context and format the output as markdown according to the Final output guidelines, using `***` for keys.",
    "relevant_tools": ["CoreLLMTask"]
  }
]
```

--- EXAMPLE (Simple Goal) ---
If the main goal is "what is the system utilization?", your output should be a single-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the system utilization using the `dba_resusageSummary` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["dba_resusageSummary"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.


USER PROMPT:

[model]: ```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,

  {
    "phase": 2,

- Data Collected So Far: {}

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If the current phase involves a loop (e.g., "for each table"), identify the next item in the sequence that has not yet been processed and select the appropriate action for that single item.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.

Checking for completion of phase: Determine the number of databases on the system using the `list_databases` tool.

--- History ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): how many databases are on the system?

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal**: Carefully read the "GOAL" to understand the user's full intent.
2.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
3.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase. This goal will guide a separate, tactical LLM.
    -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of tool names that are permitted to be used during this phase. You MUST select the most appropriate and specific tools from the full "Capabilities" list provided in the main system prompt to achieve the phase's goal.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
4.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
5.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process with a final reporting requirement, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase that handles both the synthesis of the final report AND its formatting. The `relevant_tools` for this final phase **MUST** be `["CoreLLMTask"]`.
6.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call (e.g., "list all databases", "what is the system utilization?"), your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate tool. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Types)**: You are generating a plan of executable **tools**. The `relevant_tools` list **MUST ONLY** contain names of capabilities that are explicitly marked as `(tool)` in the system's "Capabilities" list. You **MUST NOT** include the name of any capability marked as `(prompt)`.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.

--- EXAMPLE (Complex Goal) ---
If the main goal requires getting DDL and then describing/formatting, your output should be a two-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the DDL for the table 'customers' in database 'sales' using the `base_tableDDL` tool.",

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If the current phase involves a loop (e.g., "for each table"), identify the next item in the sequence that has not yet been processed and select the appropriate action for that single item.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.

--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Deciding next tactical action for phase: Determine the number of databases on the system using the `list_databases` tool.

--- History ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): how many databases are on the system?

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal**: Carefully read the "GOAL" to understand the user's full intent.
2.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
3.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase. This goal will guide a separate, tactical LLM.
    -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of tool names that are permitted to be used during this phase. You MUST select the most appropriate and specific tools from the full "Capabilities" list provided in the main system prompt to achieve the phase's goal.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
4.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
5.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process with a final reporting requirement, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase that handles both the synthesis of the final report AND its formatting. The `relevant_tools` for this final phase **MUST** be `["CoreLLMTask"]`.
6.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call (e.g., "list all databases", "what is the system utilization?"), your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate tool. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Types)**: You are generating a plan of executable **tools**. The `relevant_tools` list **MUST ONLY** contain names of capabilities that are explicitly marked as `(tool)` in the system's "Capabilities" list. You **MUST NOT** include the name of any capability marked as `(prompt)`.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.

--- EXAMPLE (Complex Goal) ---
If the main goal requires getting DDL and then describing/formatting, your output should be a two-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the DDL for the table 'customers' in database 'sales' using the `base_tableDDL` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Synthesize a final report by describing the 'customers' table in a business context and format the output as markdown according to the Final output guidelines, using `***` for keys.",
    "relevant_tools": ["CoreLLMTask"]
  }
]
```

--- EXAMPLE (Simple Goal) ---
If the main goal is "what is the system utilization?", your output should be a single-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the system utilization using the `dba_resusageSummary` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["dba_resusageSummary"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
Determine the number of databases on the system using the `list_databases` tool.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If the current phase involves a loop (e.g., "for each table"), identify the next item in the sequence that has not yet been processed and select the appropriate action for that single item.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.

Checking for completion of phase: Determine the number of databases on the system using the `list_databases` tool.

--- History ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a user's request or a complex workflow goal and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a state machine executor.

--- GOAL ---
how many databases are on the system?

--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question (for reference): how many databases are on the system?

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Goal**: Carefully read the "GOAL" to understand the user's full intent.
2.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step.
3.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase. This goal will guide a separate, tactical LLM.
    -   `"relevant_tools"`: A list of tool names that are permitted to be used during this phase. You MUST select the most appropriate and specific tools from the full "Capabilities" list provided in the main system prompt to achieve the phase's goal.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
4.  **Embed Parameters**: When defining the `"goal"` for a phase, you MUST scan the main "GOAL" for any hardcoded arguments or parameters (e.g., table names, database names) relevant to that phase's task. You MUST embed these found parameters directly into the `"goal"` string to make it self-contained and explicit.
5.  **Final Synthesis and Formatting Phase**: If the main "GOAL" describes a multi-step process with a final reporting requirement, your plan **MUST** conclude with a single, final phase that handles both the synthesis of the final report AND its formatting. The `relevant_tools` for this final phase **MUST** be `["CoreLLMTask"]`.
6.  **CRITICAL RULE (Simplicity)**: If the "GOAL" is a simple, direct request that can be answered with a single tool call (e.g., "list all databases", "what is the system utilization?"), your plan **MUST** consist of only a single phase that calls the one most appropriate tool. Do not add unnecessary synthesis phases for simple data retrieval.
7.  **CRITICAL RULE (Execution Focus)**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action. You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information. Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.
8.  **CRITICAL RULE (Capability Types)**: You are generating a plan of executable **tools**. The `relevant_tools` list **MUST ONLY** contain names of capabilities that are explicitly marked as `(tool)` in the system's "Capabilities" list. You **MUST NOT** include the name of any capability marked as `(prompt)`.
9.  **CRITICAL RULE (Efficiency)**: If a phase's `"goal"` already contains all the instructions for the final synthesis and formatting of the report (as specified in the main "GOAL"), you **MUST** make this the last phase of the plan. Do not add a separate, redundant formatting-only phase after it.

--- EXAMPLE (Complex Goal) ---
If the main goal requires getting DDL and then describing/formatting, your output should be a two-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the DDL for the table 'customers' in database 'sales' using the `base_tableDDL` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["base_tableDDL"]
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "Synthesize a final report by describing the 'customers' table in a business context and format the output as markdown according to the Final output guidelines, using `***` for keys.",
    "relevant_tools": ["CoreLLMTask"]
  }
]
```

--- EXAMPLE (Simple Goal) ---
If the main goal is "what is the system utilization?", your output should be a single-phase plan like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the system utilization using the `dba_resusageSummary` tool.",
    "relevant_tools": ["dba_resusageSummary"]
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If the current phase involves a loop (e.g., "for each table"), identify the next item in the sequence that has not yet been processed and select the appropriate action for that single item.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **CRITICAL RULE (Tool Selection)**: You **MUST** select your next action from the list of "Permitted Tools for this Phase". You are not allowed to use any other tool.
3.  **Self-Correction**: If a "Previous Attempt" is noted in the "CONSTRAINTS" section, it means your last choice was invalid. You **MUST** analyze the error and choose a different, valid tool from the permitted list. Do not repeat the invalid choice.
4.  **CoreLLMTask Usage**:
    -   For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization, you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool, but only if it is in the permitted tools list.
    -   When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** provide the `task_description` argument.
    -   Crucially, you **MUST** also determine which previous phase results are necessary for the task. You **MUST** provide these as a list of strings in the `source_data` argument.
    -   **CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE**: If the current phase involves creating a final summary or report for the user, you **MUST** ensure you have all the necessary context. Your `source_data` list **MUST** include the results from **ALL** previous data-gathering phases (e.g., `["result_of_phase_1", "result_of_phase_2"]`) to prevent information loss.
5.  **Handle Loops**: If the current phase involves a loop (e.g., "for each table"), identify the next item in the sequence that has not yet been processed and select the appropriate action for that single item.
6.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.
