--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Generating a strategic meta-plan for the 'base_tableBusinessDesc' workflow.

--- History ---
[user]: Manual execution of prompt: base_tableBusinessDesc

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are an expert strategic planning assistant. Your task is to analyze a complex, multi-step user request and decompose it into a high-level, phased meta-plan. This plan will serve as a roadmap for a state machine executor.

--- MASTER PROMPT (The User's Goal) ---
You are a Teradata DBA who is an expert in describing the business use of tables in a database.

## your role will work through the phases
Perform the phases in order, and do not skip any phase.

## Phase 0 - Get the table name and database name
- The table name is callcenter
- The database name is DEMO_Customer360_db

## Phase 1 - Get the table DDL
- Get the table DDL from the user. The DDL should be a single string, and it should not contain any new lines or special characters. Use the base_tableDDL tool to get the DDL.

## Phase 2 - Describe the table
- Describe the table in a business context. The description should be a single string. 
- The description should include the following: 
    - The purpose of the table
    - The purpose of the columns in the table

## Communication guidelines:
      - Be concise but informative in your explanations
      - Clearly indicate which phase the process is currently in
      - summarize the outcome of the phase before moving to the next phase

## Final output guidelines:
      - return in markdown
      - Example:
      ***Table Name:*** `table_name`

      ***Database Name:*** `database_name`

      ***Description:*** `table_description`

         - ***Column1:*** `column1_descriptions`
         - ***Column2:*** `column2_descriptions`
         - ***Column3:*** `column3_descriptions`


--- CONTEXT ---
- User's Original Question: Manual execution of prompt: base_tableBusinessDesc

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the Master Prompt**: Carefully read the entire "MASTER PROMPT" to identify the distinct phases, steps, and communication requirements.
2.  **Decompose into Phases**: Break down the overall goal into a sequence of logical phases. Each phase should represent a major step in the process.
3.  **Define Each Phase**: For each phase, create a JSON object with the following keys:
    -   `"phase"`: An integer representing the step number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    -   `"goal"`: A clear, concise, and actionable description of what must be accomplished in this phase. This goal will guide a separate, tactical LLM.
    -   (Optional) `"type": "loop"`: If a phase requires iterating over a list of items, you MUST include this key.
    -   (Optional) `"loop_over"`: If `"type"` is `"loop"`, specify the data source for the iteration (e.g., `"result_of_phase_1"`).
4.  **Final Phase**: The final phase should always be dedicated to synthesizing and formatting the final report according to the "Final output guidelines" in the master prompt.
5.  **CRITICAL RULE**: Every phase you define **MUST** correspond to a concrete, tool-based action described in the Master Prompt (e.g., "Get the table DDL," "Describe the table"). You **MUST NOT** create phases for simple verification, confirmation, or acknowledgement of known information (e.g., "Acknowledge the table name"). Your plan must focus only on the execution steps required to gather new information or process existing data.

--- EXAMPLE ---
If the master prompt says: "Phase 1 - get tables. Phase 2 - for each table, get DDL. Phase 3 - describe database.", your output should look like this:
```json
[
  {
    "phase": 1,
    "goal": "Get the list of all tables in the database using the `base_tableList` tool."
  },
  {
    "phase": 2,
    "goal": "For each table identified in Phase 1, get its DDL using the `base_tableDDL` tool.",
    "type": "loop",
    "loop_over": "result_of_phase_1"
  },
  {
    "phase": 3,
    "goal": "Synthesize a final, holistic business description of the entire database by analyzing the DDLs collected in Phase 2."
  }
]
```

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON list of phase objects. Do NOT add any extra text, conversation, or markdown.


USER PROMPT:

1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **Decide Next Action**: Based on your analysis, determine the single best tool to call next to make progress on the current phase's goal.
3.  **CRITICAL RULE**: You **MUST** select from the list of available **TOOLS ONLY**. You are not allowed to call a prompt. For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization (like the current phase goal might be), you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool. Pass the current phase's goal as the `task_description` argument for the `CoreLLMTask`.
4.  **Handle Loops**: If the current phase involves a loop (e.g., "for each table"), identify the next item in the sequence that has not yet been processed and select the appropriate action for that single item.
5.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **Decide Next Action**: Based on your analysis, determine the single best tool to call next to make progress on the current phase's goal.
3.  **CRITICAL RULE**: You **MUST** select from the list of available **TOOLS ONLY**. You are not allowed to call a prompt. For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization (like the current phase goal might be), you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool. Pass the current phase's goal as the `task_description` argument for the `CoreLLMTask`.
4.  **Handle Loops**: If the current phase involves a loop (e.g., "for each table"), identify the next item in the sequence that has not yet been processed and select the appropriate action for that single item.
5.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.

[user]: Manual execution of prompt: base_tableBusinessDesc

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are a tactical assistant executing a single phase of a larger plan. Your task is to decide the single best next action to take to achieve the current phase's goal.

--- OVERALL WORKFLOW GOAL ---
You are a Teradata DBA who is an expert in describing the business use of tables in a database.

## your role will work through the phases
Perform the phases in order, and do not skip any phase.

## Phase 0 - Get the table name and database name
- The table name is callcenter
- The database name is DEMO_Customer360_db

## Phase 1 - Get the table DDL
- Get the table DDL from the user. The DDL should be a single string, and it should not contain any new lines or special characters. Use the base_tableDDL tool to get the DDL.

## Phase 2 - Describe the table
- Describe the table in a business context. The description should be a single string. 
- The description should include the following: 
    - The purpose of the table
    - The purpose of the columns in the table

## Communication guidelines:
      - Be concise but informative in your explanations
      - Clearly indicate which phase the process is currently in
      - summarize the outcome of the phase before moving to the next phase

## Final output guidelines:
      - return in markdown
      - Example:
      ***Table Name:*** `table_name`

      ***Database Name:*** `database_name`

      ***Description:*** `table_description`

         - ***Column1:*** `column1_descriptions`
         - ***Column2:*** `column2_descriptions`
         - ***Column3:*** `column3_descriptions`

- Get the table DDL from the user. The DDL should be a single string, and it should not contain any new lines or special characters. Use the base_tableDDL tool to get the DDL.

## Phase 2 - Describe the table
- Describe the table in a business context. The description should be a single string. 
- The description should include the following: 
    - The purpose of the table
    - The purpose of the columns in the table

## Communication guidelines:
      - Be concise but informative in your explanations
      - Clearly indicate which phase the process is currently in
      - summarize the outcome of the phase before moving to the next phase

## Final output guidelines:
      - return in markdown
      - Example:
      ***Table Name:*** `table_name`

      ***Database Name:*** `database_name`

      ***Description:*** `table_description`

         - ***Column1:*** `column1_descriptions`
         - ***Column2:*** `column2_descriptions`
         - ***Column3:*** `column3_descriptions`


--- CURRENT PHASE GOAL ---
Describe the 'callcenter' table in a business context, including the purpose of the table and its columns, based on the DDL obtained in Phase 1.

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the State**: Review the "CURRENT PHASE GOAL" and the "WORKFLOW STATE & HISTORY" to understand what has been done and what is needed next.
2.  **Decide Next Action**: Based on your analysis, determine the single best tool to call next to make progress on the current phase's goal.
3.  **CRITICAL RULE**: You **MUST** select from the list of available **TOOLS ONLY**. You are not allowed to call a prompt. For any task that involves synthesis, analysis, description, or summarization (like the current phase goal might be), you **MUST** use the `CoreLLMTask` tool. Pass the current phase's goal as the `task_description` argument for the `CoreLLMTask`.
4.  **Handle Loops**: If the current phase involves a loop (e.g., "for each table"), identify the next item in the sequence that has not yet been processed and select the appropriate action for that single item.
5.  **Format Response**: Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object for a tool call. Do NOT add any extra text or conversation.

# Business Description of the Callcenter Table

The "callcenter" table in the DEMO_Customer360_db database stores information about call center representatives and their associated operational costs. This table appears to be part of a customer relationship management system.

## Table Purpose
This table maintains personal and contact information for call center employees along with a cost metric associated with each representative.

## Key Data Elements
- **Personal Information**: Gender, first name, and last name of call center representatives
- **Contact Information**: Complete address (street address, city, state, ZIP code) and phone number
- **Operational Metrics**: Call center cost metric (stored as a BYTEINT, suggesting a small numeric value, possibly a cost code or efficiency rating)

## Technical Characteristics
- The table is implemented as a MULTISET table, allowing duplicate rows
- It has FALLBACK protection for data recovery
- No journaling is configured (NO BEFORE/AFTER JOURNAL)
- No primary index is defined, indicating the table may be relatively small or that uniqueness is not enforced

This table likely serves as a reference for managing call center personnel costs and facilitating contact with representatives as part of a broader customer service or sales operation.

This table appears to be part of a customer relationship management system.\n\n## Table Purpose\nThis table maintains personal and contact information for call center employees along with a cost metric associated with each representative.\n\n## Key Data Elements\n- **Personal Information**: Gender, first name, and last name of call center representatives\n- **Contact Information**: Complete address (street address, city, state, ZIP code) and phone number\n- **Operational Metrics**: Call center cost metric (stored as a BYTEINT, suggesting a small numeric value, possibly a cost code or efficiency rating)\n\n## Technical Characteristics\n- The table is implemented as a MULTISET table, allowing duplicate rows\n- It has FALLBACK protection for data recovery\n- No journaling is configured (NO BEFORE/AFTER JOURNAL)\n- No primary index is defined, indicating the table may be relatively small or that uniqueness is not enforced\n\nThis table likely serves as a reference for managing call center personnel costs and facilitating contact with representatives as part of a broader customer service or sales operation."
