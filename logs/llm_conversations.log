2025-08-03 18:45:23,345 - --- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}}
}}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db"}}
}}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

**Another Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Responds with a list of tables, including `Equipment`)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "what is the quality of Equipment?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about the 'Equipment' table. The previous turns established the context of the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I must reuse this database name."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `Equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

**Example of CORRECT Multi-Step Plan:**
    -   USER: "what is the system utilization in number of queries for today?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 1): "The user is asking about 'today'. I do not know the current date. My first step must be to get the current date from the database."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 1):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "base_readQuery",
          "arguments": {{ "sql": "SELECT CURRENT_DATE" }}
        }}
        ```
    -   TOOL RESPONSE (Step 1): `{{"results": [{{"Date": "2025-07-29"}}]}}`
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 2): "The database returned the current date as 2025-07-29. Now I can use this date to answer the user's original question about system utilization."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 2):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
          "arguments": {{ "date": "2025-07-29" }}
        }}
        ```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully. If it indicates an invalid column, parameter, or dimension (e.g., 'Column not found'), identify the specific argument that caused the failure.
2.  **Consult Tool Docs:** Review the documentation for the failed tool that is provided in this system prompt.
3.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Your next thought process should explain the error and propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
4.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
5.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

[user]: what is the quality of database DEMO_Customer360_db?
[assistant]: To assess the quality of the database DEMO_Customer360_db, we'll need to use the quality assessment tools available. The most appropriate tool for this task is the `qlty_databaseQuality` prompt, which is designed to provide a comprehensive quality assessment of a database.

Here's how we'll proceed:

```json
{
  "prompt_name": "qlty_databaseQuality",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}
}
```

This prompt will guide us through a series of quality checks on the DEMO_Customer360_db database, including analyzing table structures, data completeness, consistency, and potential issues. It will use various quality-related tools to gather information and provide a comprehensive assessment.
[user]: You are a data analyst. Your task is to provide a natural language business description based on a table's DDL.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Your entire response MUST be plain text.
2. DO NOT generate JSON, tool calls, or any code.
3. Describe the likely business purpose of the table and each column.

--- DDL to Analyze ---
```sql
CREATE MULTISET TABLE DEMO_Customer360_db.CallCenter ,FALLBACK ,     NO BEFORE JOURNAL,     NO AFTER JOURNAL,     CHECKSUM = DEFAULT,     DEFAULT MERGEBLOCKRATIO,     MAP = TD_MAP1     (      GENDER VARCHAR(1) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      FIRST_NAME VARCHAR(10) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      LAST_NAME VARCHAR(9) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      ADDRESS VARCHAR(25) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      STATE VARCHAR(2) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      CITY VARCHAR(16) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      ZIPCODE INTEGER,      PHONE VARCHAR(14) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      CALL_CENTER_COST BYTEINT)NO PRIMARY INDEX ;
```

The table DEMO_Customer360_db.CallCenter appears to be designed for managing customer information and call center data within a customer relationship management (CRM) system. This table likely serves as a central repository for customer contact details and associated call center metrics. Here's a breakdown of its probable business purpose and the significance of each column:

1. GENDER: This column stores the customer's gender, which can be used for demographic analysis and personalized communication.

2. FIRST_NAME and LAST_NAME: These columns contain the customer's personal identification, essential for personalized interactions and record-keeping.

3. ADDRESS, STATE, CITY, and ZIPCODE: These fields comprise the customer's full address, crucial for geographical analysis, targeted marketing campaigns, and service delivery logistics.

4. PHONE: This stores the customer's contact number, vital for call center operations and customer outreach.

5. CALL_CENTER_COST: This BYTEINT column likely represents a metric related to the cost associated with serving this customer through the call center. It could be a categorization or a small numeric value indicating the relative expense of customer interactions.

The table structure suggests that this is part of a larger customer 360-degree view initiative, as indicated by the database name DEMO_Customer360_db. It's designed to provide a comprehensive view of customer information, enabling the business to:

1. Maintain accurate customer contact information
2. Analyze customer distribution by geography
3. Potentially segment customers based on call center interactions and associated costs
4. Support call center operations with readily available customer data

The MULTISET table type allows for duplicate rows, which might be useful if the same customer can have multiple entries (e.g., different addresses or phone numbers).

The absence of a PRIMARY INDEX suggests that the table is designed for flexibility in data loading and querying, rather than being optimized for a specific query pattern. This could indicate that various departments or systems might update this table, prioritizing ease of data insertion over query performance.

Overall, this table appears to be a cornerstone for customer data management, supporting call center operations, customer analysis, and potentially feeding into broader customer relationship management strategies.

Tool Description: "
    Get the univariate statistics for a table.

    Arguments:
      database_name - name of the database
      table_name - table name to analyze
      col_name - column name to analyze

    Returns:
      ResponseType: formatted response with query results + metadata
    "

Contextual Hint: This tool is intended for quantitative analysis. When `col_name` is an argument, it requires a 'numeric' data type.

Respond with a single, raw JSON object with one key, 'dataType', and the value 'numeric', 'character', or 'any'.
Example response for a statistical tool: {{"dataType": "numeric"}}

2025-08-03 18:45:33,882 - --- RESPONSE ---
{"dataType": "numeric"}
--------------------------------------------------

2025-08-03 18:45:44,788 - --- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}}
}}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db"}}
}}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

**Another Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Responds with a list of tables, including `Equipment`)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "what is the quality of Equipment?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about the 'Equipment' table. The previous turns established the context of the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I must reuse this database name."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `Equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

**Example of CORRECT Multi-Step Plan:**
    -   USER: "what is the system utilization in number of queries for today?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 1): "The user is asking about 'today'. I do not know the current date. My first step must be to get the current date from the database."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 1):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "base_readQuery",
          "arguments": {{ "sql": "SELECT CURRENT_DATE" }}
        }}
        ```
    -   TOOL RESPONSE (Step 1): `{{"results": [{{"Date": "2025-07-29"}}]}}`
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 2): "The database returned the current date as 2025-07-29. Now I can use this date to answer the user's original question about system utilization."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 2):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
          "arguments": {{ "date": "2025-07-29" }}
        }}
        ```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully. If it indicates an invalid column, parameter, or dimension (e.g., 'Column not found'), identify the specific argument that caused the failure.
2.  **Consult Tool Docs:** Review the documentation for the failed tool that is provided in this system prompt.
3.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Your next thought process should explain the error and propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
4.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
5.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- FULL CONTEXT (Session: c46570e6-f518-481d-8353-c0b6a30e6447) ---
[user]: what is the quality of database DEMO_Customer360_db?
[assistant]: To assess the quality of the database DEMO_Customer360_db, we'll need to use the quality assessment tools available. The most appropriate tool for this task is the `qlty_databaseQuality` prompt, which is designed to provide a comprehensive quality assessment of a database.

Here's how we'll proceed:

```json
{
  "prompt_name": "qlty_databaseQuality",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}
}
```

This prompt will guide us through a series of quality checks on the DEMO_Customer360_db database, including analyzing table structures, data completeness, consistency, and potential issues. It will use various quality-related tools to gather information and provide a comprehensive assessment.
[user]: You are a data analyst. Your task is to provide a natural language business description based on a table's DDL.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Your entire response MUST be plain text.
2. DO NOT generate JSON, tool calls, or any code.
3. Describe the likely business purpose of the table and each column.

--- DDL to Analyze ---
```sql
CREATE MULTISET TABLE DEMO_Customer360_db.Equipment ,FALLBACK ,     NO BEFORE JOURNAL,     NO AFTER JOURNAL,     CHECKSUM = DEFAULT,     DEFAULT MERGEBLOCKRATIO,     MAP = TD_MAP1     (      CUST_ID SMALLINT,      GENDER VARCHAR(1) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      FIRSTNAME VARCHAR(11) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      LASTNAME VARCHAR(9) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      ADDRESS VARCHAR(25) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      STATE VARCHAR(2) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      CITY VARCHAR(16) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      ZIP INTEGER,      EQUIP_LTV SMALLINT)NO PRIMARY INDEX ;
```

This table, named "Equipment" in the DEMO_Customer360_db database, appears to be designed for storing customer information along with equipment-related data. It likely serves as part of a customer relationship management (CRM) system or a customer equipment tracking system. Here's a breakdown of its probable business purpose and the meaning of each column:

1. CUST_ID (SMALLINT): This is likely the unique identifier for each customer. It's used to link this table with other customer-related tables in the database.

2. GENDER (VARCHAR(1)): Stores the customer's gender, probably using 'M' for male and 'F' for female. This information can be used for demographic analysis and personalized marketing.

3. FIRSTNAME (VARCHAR(11)): The customer's first name. Used for personalization in communications and customer service.

4. LASTNAME (VARCHAR(9)): The customer's last name. Also used for personalization and identification purposes.

5. ADDRESS (VARCHAR(25)): The street address of the customer. This is crucial for shipping equipment, service calls, or mailing promotional materials.

6. STATE (VARCHAR(2)): The state where the customer resides, likely stored as a two-letter abbreviation. This can be used for regional analysis and logistics planning.

7. CITY (VARCHAR(16)): The city where the customer lives. Along with state and ZIP, this completes the customer's location information.

8. ZIP (INTEGER): The customer's ZIP code. This is important for logistics, targeted marketing, and demographic analysis.

9. EQUIP_LTV (SMALLINT): This likely stands for "Equipment Lifetime Value." It could represent the total value of equipment the customer has purchased or leased, or perhaps a score indicating the customer's potential value in terms of equipment sales or rentals.

The table is created as a MULTISET table, which allows duplicate rows. This might be useful if the same customer can have multiple equipment entries. The table doesn't have a primary index, which suggests that it might be frequently updated or that queries against it are diverse and not consistently based on a single column.

Overall, this table seems to be part of a system that tracks customers and their relationship to equipment, possibly for a business that sells, leases, or services equipment. It combines basic customer information with a measure of the customer's value in terms of equipment, allowing the business to analyze customer demographics, manage equipment-related transactions, and potentially target marketing or sales efforts based on customer location and equipment lifetime value.

2025-08-03 18:45:57,545 - --- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}}
}}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db"}}
}}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

**Another Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Responds with a list of tables, including `Equipment`)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "what is the quality of Equipment?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about the 'Equipment' table. The previous turns established the context of the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I must reuse this database name."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `Equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

**Example of CORRECT Multi-Step Plan:**
    -   USER: "what is the system utilization in number of queries for today?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 1): "The user is asking about 'today'. I do not know the current date. My first step must be to get the current date from the database."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 1):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "base_readQuery",
          "arguments": {{ "sql": "SELECT CURRENT_DATE" }}
        }}
        ```
    -   TOOL RESPONSE (Step 1): `{{"results": [{{"Date": "2025-07-29"}}]}}`
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 2): "The database returned the current date as 2025-07-29. Now I can use this date to answer the user's original question about system utilization."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 2):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
          "arguments": {{ "date": "2025-07-29" }}
        }}
        ```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully. If it indicates an invalid column, parameter, or dimension (e.g., 'Column not found'), identify the specific argument that caused the failure.
2.  **Consult Tool Docs:** Review the documentation for the failed tool that is provided in this system prompt.
3.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Your next thought process should explain the error and propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
4.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
5.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- FULL CONTEXT (Session: c46570e6-f518-481d-8353-c0b6a30e6447) ---
[user]: what is the quality of database DEMO_Customer360_db?
[assistant]: To assess the quality of the database DEMO_Customer360_db, we'll need to use the quality assessment tools available. The most appropriate tool for this task is the `qlty_databaseQuality` prompt, which is designed to provide a comprehensive quality assessment of a database.

Here's how we'll proceed:

```json
{
  "prompt_name": "qlty_databaseQuality",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}
}
```

This prompt will guide us through a series of quality checks on the DEMO_Customer360_db database, including analyzing table structures, data completeness, consistency, and potential issues. It will use various quality-related tools to gather information and provide a comprehensive assessment.
[user]: You are a data analyst. Your task is to provide a natural language business description based on a table's DDL.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Your entire response MUST be plain text.
2. DO NOT generate JSON, tool calls, or any code.
3. Describe the likely business purpose of the table and each column.

--- DDL to Analyze ---
```sql
CREATE MULTISET TABLE DEMO_Customer360_db.Online ,FALLBACK ,     NO BEFORE JOURNAL,     NO AFTER JOURNAL,     CHECKSUM = DEFAULT,     DEFAULT MERGEBLOCKRATIO,     MAP = TD_MAP1     (      LOYALTY_NUM INTEGER,      SEX VARCHAR(1) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      FNAME VARCHAR(11) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      LNAME VARCHAR(9) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      ADDR VARCHAR(25) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      STATE VARCHAR(2) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      CITY VARCHAR(16) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      ZIP INTEGER,      EMAIL VARCHAR(31) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC,      ONLINE_LTV SMALLINT)NO PRIMARY INDEX ;

The table "Online" in the DEMO_Customer360_db database appears to be part of a customer relationship management (CRM) system, specifically focused on online customer data. This table likely serves as a central repository for customer information related to online interactions and purchases. Here's a breakdown of its likely business purpose and the significance of each column:

Table Purpose:
The "Online" table seems to store essential information about customers who have interacted with the business through online channels. It combines personal information, contact details, and a measure of customer value, which is crucial for customer segmentation, targeted marketing, and analyzing online customer behavior.

Column Descriptions:

1. LOYALTY_NUM (INTEGER): This is probably a unique identifier for each customer in the loyalty program. It's used to track individual customers across different interactions and systems.

2. SEX (VARCHAR(1)): Indicates the customer's gender, likely stored as 'M' for male and 'F' for female. This information can be used for demographic analysis and personalized marketing.

3. FNAME (VARCHAR(11)): The customer's first name, used for personalized communication and customer service.

4. LNAME (VARCHAR(9)): The customer's last name, also used for personalized communication and customer identification.

5. ADDR (VARCHAR(25)): The customer's street address, essential for shipping physical products and for geographic analysis of the customer base.

6. STATE (VARCHAR(2)): The state where the customer resides, likely stored as a two-letter abbreviation. This is useful for regional marketing campaigns and logistics planning.

7. CITY (VARCHAR(16)): The city where the customer lives, providing more detailed geographic information for localized marketing efforts.

8. ZIP (INTEGER): The customer's ZIP code, useful for precise geographic targeting and logistics planning.

9. EMAIL (VARCHAR(31)): The customer's email address, crucial for digital communication, email marketing, and as a potential username for online accounts.

10. ONLINE_LTV (SMALLINT): This likely stands for "Online Lifetime Value," a metric that represents the total value of a customer's online purchases over their lifetime. It's a crucial metric for customer segmentation and determining the most valuable online customers.

Additional Observations:
- The table is created as a MULTISET table, allowing duplicate rows, which might be useful if the same customer can have multiple entries for different online interactions.
- There's no primary index defined, which might impact query performance but could be beneficial for faster data loading in a high-volume online transaction environment.
- The use of FALLBACK suggests that data reliability is important, as it ensures a backup copy of the data is maintained.

In summary, this table is central to managing and analyzing online customer relationships, combining personal information with online behavior metrics to support marketing, sales, and customer service operations in an e-commerce or online business context.

2025-08-03 18:46:09,392 - --- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}}
}}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db"}}
}}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

**Another Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Responds with a list of tables, including `Equipment`)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "what is the quality of Equipment?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about the 'Equipment' table. The previous turns established the context of the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I must reuse this database name."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `Equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

**Example of CORRECT Multi-Step Plan:**
    -   USER: "what is the system utilization in number of queries for today?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 1): "The user is asking about 'today'. I do not know the current date. My first step must be to get the current date from the database."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 1):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "base_readQuery",
          "arguments": {{ "sql": "SELECT CURRENT_DATE" }}
        }}
        ```
    -   TOOL RESPONSE (Step 1): `{{"results": [{{"Date": "2025-07-29"}}]}}`
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 2): "The database returned the current date as 2025-07-29. Now I can use this date to answer the user's original question about system utilization."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 2):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
          "arguments": {{ "date": "2025-07-29" }}
        }}
        ```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully. If it indicates an invalid column, parameter, or dimension (e.g., 'Column not found'), identify the specific argument that caused the failure.
2.  **Consult Tool Docs:** Review the documentation for the failed tool that is provided in this system prompt.
3.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Your next thought process should explain the error and propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
4.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
5.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

This table, named "Cookie" in the DEMO_Customer360_db database, appears to be designed for tracking customer interactions and campaign data, likely for marketing or customer relationship management purposes. Here's a breakdown of its likely business purpose and the significance of each column:

1. Table Purpose:
   The "Cookie" table seems to store information about customer locations and their associated online identifiers (cookies) along with campaign data. This suggests it's used for tracking customer interactions across different marketing campaigns and analyzing their geographical distribution.

2. Column Descriptions:

   a. ADDR_LN_1_TXT: 
      This column likely stores the first line of a customer's address. It could be used for mailing purposes or to analyze customer distribution by street address.

   b. ST_OR_PROV_CD: 
      Probably stands for "State or Province Code." This two-character field likely contains standardized codes for states or provinces, useful for geographical segmentation and regional analysis.

   c. CITY_NAME: 
      Stores the name of the city where the customer is located. This can be used for city-level analysis of customer distribution and targeted marketing efforts.

   d. ZIP: 
      An integer field storing the ZIP code. This allows for more granular geographical analysis and can be used for targeted local marketing campaigns.

   e. COOKIE: 
      This is likely a unique identifier for tracking individual users across web sessions. It's crucial for personalized marketing, user behavior analysis, and maintaining continuity in user interactions.

   f. CAMPAIGN: 
      This field probably stores an identifier for specific marketing campaigns. It allows the business to track which campaigns are associated with which customers, enabling analysis of campaign effectiveness and customer acquisition channels.

The structure of this table suggests that the business is focused on digital marketing and customer analytics. By combining geographical data with online identifiers and campaign information, the company can perform various analyses such as:

1. Tracking the geographical reach of different marketing campaigns
2. Analyzing customer behavior and preferences based on location
3. Personalizing marketing efforts using both online behavior (via cookies) and geographical data
4. Measuring the effectiveness of campaigns across different regions
5. Potentially integrating online and offline customer data for a more comprehensive view of customer interactions

The absence of a primary index suggests that this table might be frequently updated or appended to, possibly in real-time as customer interactions occur. This design choice allows for faster data insertion at the potential cost of slower query performance, which might be acceptable if the primary use case is rapid data collection rather than real-time querying.
