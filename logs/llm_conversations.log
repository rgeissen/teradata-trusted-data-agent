2025-08-12 11:27:15,883 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 0f1a976c-17f0-4ebc-9411-98da7f6ee1e9) ---
--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Analyzing user query to determine the first action.

--- History ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: ONE ACTION AT A TIME** ---
You **MUST** generate only one tool or prompt call in a single turn. Do not chain multiple JSON blocks together. After you receive the result from your action, you can then decide on the next step. This is a strict instruction.

--- **CRITICAL RULE on `FINAL_ANSWER`** ---
When you have a complete answer for the user, you MUST stop calling tools or prompts. Your response MUST be a single plain text string that begins with the exact prefix 'FINAL_ANSWER:'. DO NOT wrap this final response in a JSON object or use the keys 'prompt_name' or 'tool_name'.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING OUT-OF-SCOPE QUERIES** ---
If the user's request cannot be fulfilled by any of the available tools or prompts, or if it is a general conversational query that does not pertain to database operations (and is not a simple greeting handled by the system), you **MUST** respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that clearly states you cannot assist with that particular request and offer to help with database-related tasks. Do NOT attempt to force a tool call or invent a response.

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}
}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db"}
}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: COLUMN-LEVEL TOOL EXECUTION** ---
When operating on a table, if the next step in a plan requires a column-level tool (a tool with a `col_name` or `column_name` parameter), you MUST first identify all relevant columns for that tool from the data you have already gathered. Then, you MUST execute the tool for each of those relevant columns sequentially.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: RECOVERY VS. COMPLETION** ---
If a tool call fails, but a PREVIOUS tool call in the same turn has already provided enough information to answer the user's original question, you **MUST** ignore the failure. Your priority is to answer the user. In this situation, you MUST provide a `FINAL_ANSWER` using the data you have already successfully collected.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

2025-08-12 11:27:17,136 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 0f1a976c-17f0-4ebc-9411-98da7f6ee1e9) ---
--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Deciding next action based on tool result.

--- History ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: ONE ACTION AT A TIME** ---
You **MUST** generate only one tool or prompt call in a single turn. Do not chain multiple JSON blocks together. After you receive the result from your action, you can then decide on the next step. This is a strict instruction.

--- **CRITICAL RULE on `FINAL_ANSWER`** ---
When you have a complete answer for the user, you MUST stop calling tools or prompts. Your response MUST be a single plain text string that begins with the exact prefix 'FINAL_ANSWER:'. DO NOT wrap this final response in a JSON object or use the keys 'prompt_name' or 'tool_name'.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING OUT-OF-SCOPE QUERIES** ---
If the user's request cannot be fulfilled by any of the available tools or prompts, or if it is a general conversational query that does not pertain to database operations (and is not a simple greeting handled by the system), you **MUST** respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that clearly states you cannot assist with that particular request and offer to help with database-related tasks. Do NOT attempt to force a tool call or invent a response.

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}
}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db"}
}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: COLUMN-LEVEL TOOL EXECUTION** ---
When operating on a table, if the next step in a plan requires a column-level tool (a tool with a `col_name` or `column_name` parameter), you MUST first identify all relevant columns for that tool from the data you have already gathered. Then, you MUST execute the tool for each of those relevant columns sequentially.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: RECOVERY VS. COMPLETION** ---
If a tool call fails, but a PREVIOUS tool call in the same turn has already provided enough information to answer the user's original question, you **MUST** ignore the failure. Your priority is to answer the user. In this situation, you MUST provide a `FINAL_ANSWER` using the data you have already successfully collected.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: ONE ACTION AT A TIME** ---
You **MUST** generate only one tool or prompt call in a single turn. Do not chain multiple JSON blocks together. After you receive the result from your action, you can then decide on the next step. This is a strict instruction.

--- **CRITICAL RULE on `FINAL_ANSWER`** ---
When you have a complete answer for the user, you MUST stop calling tools or prompts. Your response MUST be a single plain text string that begins with the exact prefix 'FINAL_ANSWER:'. DO NOT wrap this final response in a JSON object or use the keys 'prompt_name' or 'tool_name'.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING OUT-OF-SCOPE QUERIES** ---
If the user's request cannot be fulfilled by any of the available tools or prompts, or if it is a general conversational query that does not pertain to database operations (and is not a simple greeting handled by the system), you **MUST** respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that clearly states you cannot assist with that particular request and offer to help with database-related tasks. Do NOT attempt to force a tool call or invent a response.

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}
}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db"}
}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: COLUMN-LEVEL TOOL EXECUTION** ---
When operating on a table, if the next step in a plan requires a column-level tool (a tool with a `col_name` or `column_name` parameter), you MUST first identify all relevant columns for that tool from the data you have already gathered. Then, you MUST execute the tool for each of those relevant columns sequentially.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: RECOVERY VS. COMPLETION** ---
If a tool call fails, but a PREVIOUS tool call in the same turn has already provided enough information to answer the user's original question, you **MUST** ignore the failure. Your priority is to answer the user. In this situation, you MUST provide a `FINAL_ANSWER` using the data you have already successfully collected.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

USER PROMPT:
You are an assistant that has just received data from a tool call. Your task is to decide if this data is enough to answer the user's original question, or if another step is needed.

--- User's Original Question ---
'compare the system utilization between today and yesterday'

--- Data from Last Tool Call ---
{"tool_name": "util_getCurrentDate", "tool_output": {"status": "success", "metadata": {"tool_name": "util_getCurrentDate"}, "results": [{"current_date": "2025-08-12"}]}}

--- Your Decision Process ---
1.  **Analyze the Data:** Does the data above directly and completely answer the user's original question?
2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If the data IS sufficient, your response **MUST** be only the exact string `FINAL_ANSWER:`. Do not add any summary text. The system will generate the final summary.
    -   If the data is NOT sufficient and you need more information, call another tool or prompt by providing the appropriate JSON block.
    -   If the last tool call resulted in an error, you MUST attempt to recover.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a JSON-only responding assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a query classifier. Your only task is to analyze a user's request for date information. Analyze the following query: 'compare the system utilization between today and yesterday'. First, determine if it refers to a 'single' date or a 'range' of dates. Second, extract the specific phrase that describes the date or range. Your response MUST be ONLY a JSON object with two keys: 'type' and 'phrase'.

2025-08-12 11:27:17,704 - --- RESPONSE ---
```json
{
  "type": "range",
  "phrase": "today and yesterday"
}
```

2025-08-12 11:27:19,563 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 0f1a976c-17f0-4ebc-9411-98da7f6ee1e9) ---
--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Deciding next action based on tool result.

--- History ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: ONE ACTION AT A TIME** ---
You **MUST** generate only one tool or prompt call in a single turn. Do not chain multiple JSON blocks together. After you receive the result from your action, you can then decide on the next step. This is a strict instruction.

--- **CRITICAL RULE on `FINAL_ANSWER`** ---
When you have a complete answer for the user, you MUST stop calling tools or prompts. Your response MUST be a single plain text string that begins with the exact prefix 'FINAL_ANSWER:'. DO NOT wrap this final response in a JSON object or use the keys 'prompt_name' or 'tool_name'.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING OUT-OF-SCOPE QUERIES** ---
If the user's request cannot be fulfilled by any of the available tools or prompts, or if it is a general conversational query that does not pertain to database operations (and is not a simple greeting handled by the system), you **MUST** respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that clearly states you cannot assist with that particular request and offer to help with database-related tasks. Do NOT attempt to force a tool call or invent a response.

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}
}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db"}
}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: COLUMN-LEVEL TOOL EXECUTION** ---
When operating on a table, if the next step in a plan requires a column-level tool (a tool with a `col_name` or `column_name` parameter), you MUST first identify all relevant columns for that tool from the data you have already gathered. Then, you MUST execute the tool for each of those relevant columns sequentially.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: RECOVERY VS. COMPLETION** ---
If a tool call fails, but a PREVIOUS tool call in the same turn has already provided enough information to answer the user's original question, you **MUST** ignore the failure. Your priority is to answer the user. In this situation, you MUST provide a `FINAL_ANSWER` using the data you have already successfully collected.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

USER PROMPT:
compare the system utilization between today and yesterday
[model]: ```json
{
  "tool_name": "util_getCurrentDate"
}
```

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: ONE ACTION AT A TIME** ---
You **MUST** generate only one tool or prompt call in a single turn. Do not chain multiple JSON blocks together. After you receive the result from your action, you can then decide on the next step. This is a strict instruction.

--- **CRITICAL RULE on `FINAL_ANSWER`** ---
When you have a complete answer for the user, you MUST stop calling tools or prompts. Your response MUST be a single plain text string that begins with the exact prefix 'FINAL_ANSWER:'. DO NOT wrap this final response in a JSON object or use the keys 'prompt_name' or 'tool_name'.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING OUT-OF-SCOPE QUERIES** ---
If the user's request cannot be fulfilled by any of the available tools or prompts, or if it is a general conversational query that does not pertain to database operations (and is not a simple greeting handled by the system), you **MUST** respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that clearly states you cannot assist with that particular request and offer to help with database-related tasks. Do NOT attempt to force a tool call or invent a response.

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}
}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db"}
}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: COLUMN-LEVEL TOOL EXECUTION** ---
When operating on a table, if the next step in a plan requires a column-level tool (a tool with a `col_name` or `column_name` parameter), you MUST first identify all relevant columns for that tool from the data you have already gathered. Then, you MUST execute the tool for each of those relevant columns sequentially.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: RECOVERY VS. COMPLETION** ---
If a tool call fails, but a PREVIOUS tool call in the same turn has already provided enough information to answer the user's original question, you **MUST** ignore the failure. Your priority is to answer the user. In this situation, you MUST provide a `FINAL_ANSWER` using the data you have already successfully collected.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

USER PROMPT:
You are an assistant that has just received data from a tool call. Your task is to decide if this data is enough to answer the user's original question, or if another step is needed.

--- User's Original Question ---
'compare the system utilization between today and yesterday'

--- Data from Last Tool Call ---
{"tool_name": "util_getCurrentDate", "tool_output": {"status": "success", "metadata": {"tool_name": "util_getCurrentDate"}, "results": [{"current_date": "2025-08-12"}]}}

--- Your Decision Process ---
1.  **Analyze the Data:** Does the data above directly and completely answer the user's original question?
2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If the data IS sufficient, your response **MUST** be only the exact string `FINAL_ANSWER:`. Do not add any summary text. The system will generate the final summary.
    -   If the data is NOT sufficient and you need more information, call another tool or prompt by providing the appropriate JSON block.
    -   If the last tool call resulted in an error, you MUST attempt to recover.

[model]: ```json
{
  "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
  "arguments": {
    "dimensions": ["LogDate", "hourOfDay", "dayOfWeek", "workloadType", "workloadComplexity"],
    "date": "2025-08-11",
    "date": "2025-08-12"
  }
}
```


--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: ONE ACTION AT A TIME** ---
You **MUST** generate only one tool or prompt call in a single turn. Do not chain multiple JSON blocks together. After you receive the result from your action, you can then decide on the next step. This is a strict instruction.

--- **CRITICAL RULE on `FINAL_ANSWER`** ---
When you have a complete answer for the user, you MUST stop calling tools or prompts. Your response MUST be a single plain text string that begins with the exact prefix 'FINAL_ANSWER:'. DO NOT wrap this final response in a JSON object or use the keys 'prompt_name' or 'tool_name'.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING OUT-OF-SCOPE QUERIES** ---
If the user's request cannot be fulfilled by any of the available tools or prompts, or if it is a general conversational query that does not pertain to database operations (and is not a simple greeting handled by the system), you **MUST** respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that clearly states you cannot assist with that particular request and offer to help with database-related tasks. Do NOT attempt to force a tool call or invent a response.

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}
}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db"}
}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: COLUMN-LEVEL TOOL EXECUTION** ---
When operating on a table, if the next step in a plan requires a column-level tool (a tool with a `col_name` or `column_name` parameter), you MUST first identify all relevant columns for that tool from the data you have already gathered. Then, you MUST execute the tool for each of those relevant columns sequentially.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: RECOVERY VS. COMPLETION** ---
If a tool call fails, but a PREVIOUS tool call in the same turn has already provided enough information to answer the user's original question, you **MUST** ignore the failure. Your priority is to answer the user. In this situation, you MUST provide a `FINAL_ANSWER` using the data you have already successfully collected.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- Charting is disabled. Do NOT use any charting tools.

--- Your Decision Process ---
1.  **Analyze the Data:** Does the data above directly and completely answer the user's original question?
2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If the data IS sufficient, your response **MUST** be only the exact string `FINAL_ANSWER:`. Do not add any summary text. The system will generate the final summary.
    -   If the data is NOT sufficient and you need more information, call another tool or prompt by providing the appropriate JSON block.
    -   If the last tool call resulted in an error, you MUST attempt to recover.

2025-08-12 11:27:20,068 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: one-off) ---
--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Classifying date query.

--- History ---


--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a JSON-only responding assistant.

USER PROMPT:
You are a query classifier. Your only task is to analyze a user's request for date information. Analyze the following query: 'compare the system utilization between today and yesterday'. First, determine if it refers to a 'single' date or a 'range' of dates. Second, extract the specific phrase that describes the date or range. Your response MUST be ONLY a JSON object with two keys: 'type' and 'phrase'.

2025-08-12 11:27:20,068 - --- RESPONSE ---
```json
{
  "type": "range",
  "phrase": "today and yesterday"
}
```
--------------------------------------------------

2025-08-12 11:27:21,976 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 0f1a976c-17f0-4ebc-9411-98da7f6ee1e9) ---
--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Deciding next action based on tool result.

--- History ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: ONE ACTION AT A TIME** ---
You **MUST** generate only one tool or prompt call in a single turn. Do not chain multiple JSON blocks together. After you receive the result from your action, you can then decide on the next step. This is a strict instruction.

--- **CRITICAL RULE on `FINAL_ANSWER`** ---
When you have a complete answer for the user, you MUST stop calling tools or prompts. Your response MUST be a single plain text string that begins with the exact prefix 'FINAL_ANSWER:'. DO NOT wrap this final response in a JSON object or use the keys 'prompt_name' or 'tool_name'.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING OUT-OF-SCOPE QUERIES** ---
If the user's request cannot be fulfilled by any of the available tools or prompts, or if it is a general conversational query that does not pertain to database operations (and is not a simple greeting handled by the system), you **MUST** respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that clearly states you cannot assist with that particular request and offer to help with database-related tasks. Do NOT attempt to force a tool call or invent a response.

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}
}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db"}
}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: COLUMN-LEVEL TOOL EXECUTION** ---
When operating on a table, if the next step in a plan requires a column-level tool (a tool with a `col_name` or `column_name` parameter), you MUST first identify all relevant columns for that tool from the data you have already gathered. Then, you MUST execute the tool for each of those relevant columns sequentially.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: RECOVERY VS. COMPLETION** ---
If a tool call fails, but a PREVIOUS tool call in the same turn has already provided enough information to answer the user's original question, you **MUST** ignore the failure. Your priority is to answer the user. In this situation, you MUST provide a `FINAL_ANSWER` using the data you have already successfully collected.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

USER PROMPT:
compare the system utilization between today and yesterday
[model]: ```json
{
  "tool_name": "util_getCurrentDate"
}
```

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: ONE ACTION AT A TIME** ---
You **MUST** generate only one tool or prompt call in a single turn. Do not chain multiple JSON blocks together. After you receive the result from your action, you can then decide on the next step. This is a strict instruction.

--- **CRITICAL RULE on `FINAL_ANSWER`** ---
When you have a complete answer for the user, you MUST stop calling tools or prompts. Your response MUST be a single plain text string that begins with the exact prefix 'FINAL_ANSWER:'. DO NOT wrap this final response in a JSON object or use the keys 'prompt_name' or 'tool_name'.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING OUT-OF-SCOPE QUERIES** ---
If the user's request cannot be fulfilled by any of the available tools or prompts, or if it is a general conversational query that does not pertain to database operations (and is not a simple greeting handled by the system), you **MUST** respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that clearly states you cannot assist with that particular request and offer to help with database-related tasks. Do NOT attempt to force a tool call or invent a response.

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}
}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db"}
}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: COLUMN-LEVEL TOOL EXECUTION** ---
When operating on a table, if the next step in a plan requires a column-level tool (a tool with a `col_name` or `column_name` parameter), you MUST first identify all relevant columns for that tool from the data you have already gathered. Then, you MUST execute the tool for each of those relevant columns sequentially.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: RECOVERY VS. COMPLETION** ---
If a tool call fails, but a PREVIOUS tool call in the same turn has already provided enough information to answer the user's original question, you **MUST** ignore the failure. Your priority is to answer the user. In this situation, you MUST provide a `FINAL_ANSWER` using the data you have already successfully collected.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

- Charting is disabled. Do NOT use any charting tools.

USER PROMPT:
You are an assistant that has just received data from a tool call. Your task is to decide if this data is enough to answer the user's original question, or if another step is needed.

--- User's Original Question ---
'compare the system utilization between today and yesterday'

--- Data from Last Tool Call ---
{"tool_name": "util_getCurrentDate", "tool_output": {"status": "success", "metadata": {"tool_name": "util_getCurrentDate"}, "results": [{"current_date": "2025-08-12"}]}}

--- Your Decision Process ---
1.  **Analyze the Data:** Does the data above directly and completely answer the user's original question?
2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If the data IS sufficient, your response **MUST** be only the exact string `FINAL_ANSWER:`. Do not add any summary text. The system will generate the final summary.
    -   If the data is NOT sufficient and you need more information, call another tool or prompt by providing the appropriate JSON block.
    -   If the last tool call resulted in an error, you MUST attempt to recover.

[model]: ```json
{
  "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
  "arguments": {
    "dimensions": ["LogDate", "hourOfDay", "dayOfWeek", "workloadType", "workloadComplexity"],
    "date": "2025-08-11",
    "date": "2025-08-12"
  }
}
```

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: ONE ACTION AT A TIME** ---
You **MUST** generate only one tool or prompt call in a single turn. Do not chain multiple JSON blocks together. After you receive the result from your action, you can then decide on the next step. This is a strict instruction.

--- **CRITICAL RULE on `FINAL_ANSWER`** ---
When you have a complete answer for the user, you MUST stop calling tools or prompts. Your response MUST be a single plain text string that begins with the exact prefix 'FINAL_ANSWER:'. DO NOT wrap this final response in a JSON object or use the keys 'prompt_name' or 'tool_name'.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING OUT-OF-SCOPE QUERIES** ---
If the user's request cannot be fulfilled by any of the available tools or prompts, or if it is a general conversational query that does not pertain to database operations (and is not a simple greeting handled by the system), you **MUST** respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that clearly states you cannot assist with that particular request and offer to help with database-related tasks. Do NOT attempt to force a tool call or invent a response.

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}
}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db"}
}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: COLUMN-LEVEL TOOL EXECUTION** ---
When operating on a table, if the next step in a plan requires a column-level tool (a tool with a `col_name` or `column_name` parameter), you MUST first identify all relevant columns for that tool from the data you have already gathered. Then, you MUST execute the tool for each of those relevant columns sequentially.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: RECOVERY VS. COMPLETION** ---
If a tool call fails, but a PREVIOUS tool call in the same turn has already provided enough information to answer the user's original question, you **MUST** ignore the failure. Your priority is to answer the user. In this situation, you MUST provide a `FINAL_ANSWER` using the data you have already successfully collected.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- Charting is disabled. Do NOT use any charting tools.

--- Your Decision Process ---
1.  **Analyze the Data:** Does the data above directly and completely answer the user's original question?
2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If the data IS sufficient, your response **MUST** be only the exact string `FINAL_ANSWER:`. Do not add any summary text. The system will generate the final summary.
    -   If the data is NOT sufficient and you need more information, call another tool or prompt by providing the appropriate JSON block.
    -   If the last tool call resulted in an error, you MUST attempt to recover.

[model]: ```json
{
  "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
  "arguments": {
    "dimensions": ["LogDate", "hourOfDay", "dayOfWeek", "workloadType", "workloadComplexity"],
    "date": "2025-08-11"
  }
}
```


--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: ONE ACTION AT A TIME** ---
You **MUST** generate only one tool or prompt call in a single turn. Do not chain multiple JSON blocks together. After you receive the result from your action, you can then decide on the next step. This is a strict instruction.

--- **CRITICAL RULE on `FINAL_ANSWER`** ---
When you have a complete answer for the user, you MUST stop calling tools or prompts. Your response MUST be a single plain text string that begins with the exact prefix 'FINAL_ANSWER:'. DO NOT wrap this final response in a JSON object or use the keys 'prompt_name' or 'tool_name'.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING OUT-OF-SCOPE QUERIES** ---
If the user's request cannot be fulfilled by any of the available tools or prompts, or if it is a general conversational query that does not pertain to database operations (and is not a simple greeting handled by the system), you **MUST** respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that clearly states you cannot assist with that particular request and offer to help with database-related tasks. Do NOT attempt to force a tool call or invent a response.

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}
}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db"}
}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: COLUMN-LEVEL TOOL EXECUTION** ---
When operating on a table, if the next step in a plan requires a column-level tool (a tool with a `col_name` or `column_name` parameter), you MUST first identify all relevant columns for that tool from the data you have already gathered. Then, you MUST execute the tool for each of those relevant columns sequentially.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: RECOVERY VS. COMPLETION** ---
If a tool call fails, but a PREVIOUS tool call in the same turn has already provided enough information to answer the user's original question, you **MUST** ignore the failure. Your priority is to answer the user. In this situation, you MUST provide a `FINAL_ANSWER` using the data you have already successfully collected.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

- Charting is disabled. Do NOT use any charting tools.

--- Your Decision Process ---
1.  **Analyze the Data:** Does the data above directly and completely answer the user's original question?
2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If the data IS sufficient, your response **MUST** be only the exact string `FINAL_ANSWER:`. Do not add any summary text. The system will generate the final summary.
    -   If the data is NOT sufficient and you need more information, call another tool or prompt by providing the appropriate JSON block.
    -   If the last tool call resulted in an error, you MUST attempt to recover.

FINAL_ANSWER:
--------------------------------------------------

2025-08-12 11:27:26,045 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 0f1a976c-17f0-4ebc-9411-98da7f6ee1e9) ---
--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Generating final, insightful summary.

--- History ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: ONE ACTION AT A TIME** ---
You **MUST** generate only one tool or prompt call in a single turn. Do not chain multiple JSON blocks together. After you receive the result from your action, you can then decide on the next step. This is a strict instruction.

--- **CRITICAL RULE on `FINAL_ANSWER`** ---
When you have a complete answer for the user, you MUST stop calling tools or prompts. Your response MUST be a single plain text string that begins with the exact prefix 'FINAL_ANSWER:'. DO NOT wrap this final response in a JSON object or use the keys 'prompt_name' or 'tool_name'.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING OUT-OF-SCOPE QUERIES** ---
If the user's request cannot be fulfilled by any of the available tools or prompts, or if it is a general conversational query that does not pertain to database operations (and is not a simple greeting handled by the system), you **MUST** respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that clearly states you cannot assist with that particular request and offer to help with database-related tasks. Do NOT attempt to force a tool call or invent a response.

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}
}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db"}
}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: COLUMN-LEVEL TOOL EXECUTION** ---
When operating on a table, if the next step in a plan requires a column-level tool (a tool with a `col_name` or `column_name` parameter), you MUST first identify all relevant columns for that tool from the data you have already gathered. Then, you MUST execute the tool for each of those relevant columns sequentially.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: RECOVERY VS. COMPLETION** ---
If a tool call fails, but a PREVIOUS tool call in the same turn has already provided enough information to answer the user's original question, you **MUST** ignore the failure. Your priority is to answer the user. In this situation, you MUST provide a `FINAL_ANSWER` using the data you have already successfully collected.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

USER PROMPT:
compare the system utilization between today and yesterday
[model]: ```json
{
  "tool_name": "util_getCurrentDate"
}
```

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: ONE ACTION AT A TIME** ---
You **MUST** generate only one tool or prompt call in a single turn. Do not chain multiple JSON blocks together. After you receive the result from your action, you can then decide on the next step. This is a strict instruction.

--- **CRITICAL RULE on `FINAL_ANSWER`** ---
When you have a complete answer for the user, you MUST stop calling tools or prompts. Your response MUST be a single plain text string that begins with the exact prefix 'FINAL_ANSWER:'. DO NOT wrap this final response in a JSON object or use the keys 'prompt_name' or 'tool_name'.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING OUT-OF-SCOPE QUERIES** ---
If the user's request cannot be fulfilled by any of the available tools or prompts, or if it is a general conversational query that does not pertain to database operations (and is not a simple greeting handled by the system), you **MUST** respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that clearly states you cannot assist with that particular request and offer to help with database-related tasks. Do NOT attempt to force a tool call or invent a response.

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}
}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db"}
}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: COLUMN-LEVEL TOOL EXECUTION** ---
When operating on a table, if the next step in a plan requires a column-level tool (a tool with a `col_name` or `column_name` parameter), you MUST first identify all relevant columns for that tool from the data you have already gathered. Then, you MUST execute the tool for each of those relevant columns sequentially.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: RECOVERY VS. COMPLETION** ---
If a tool call fails, but a PREVIOUS tool call in the same turn has already provided enough information to answer the user's original question, you **MUST** ignore the failure. Your priority is to answer the user. In this situation, you MUST provide a `FINAL_ANSWER` using the data you have already successfully collected.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

- Charting is disabled. Do NOT use any charting tools.

USER PROMPT:
You are an assistant that has just received data from a tool call. Your task is to decide if this data is enough to answer the user's original question, or if another step is needed.

--- User's Original Question ---
'compare the system utilization between today and yesterday'

--- Data from Last Tool Call ---
{"tool_name": "util_getCurrentDate", "tool_output": {"status": "success", "metadata": {"tool_name": "util_getCurrentDate"}, "results": [{"current_date": "2025-08-12"}]}}

--- Your Decision Process ---
1.  **Analyze the Data:** Does the data above directly and completely answer the user's original question?
2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If the data IS sufficient, your response **MUST** be only the exact string `FINAL_ANSWER:`. Do not add any summary text. The system will generate the final summary.
    -   If the data is NOT sufficient and you need more information, call another tool or prompt by providing the appropriate JSON block.
    -   If the last tool call resulted in an error, you MUST attempt to recover.

[model]: ```json
{
  "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
  "arguments": {
    "dimensions": ["LogDate", "hourOfDay", "dayOfWeek", "workloadType", "workloadComplexity"],
    "date": "2025-08-11",
    "date": "2025-08-12"
  }
}
```

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: ONE ACTION AT A TIME** ---
You **MUST** generate only one tool or prompt call in a single turn. Do not chain multiple JSON blocks together. After you receive the result from your action, you can then decide on the next step. This is a strict instruction.

--- **CRITICAL RULE on `FINAL_ANSWER`** ---
When you have a complete answer for the user, you MUST stop calling tools or prompts. Your response MUST be a single plain text string that begins with the exact prefix 'FINAL_ANSWER:'. DO NOT wrap this final response in a JSON object or use the keys 'prompt_name' or 'tool_name'.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING OUT-OF-SCOPE QUERIES** ---
If the user's request cannot be fulfilled by any of the available tools or prompts, or if it is a general conversational query that does not pertain to database operations (and is not a simple greeting handled by the system), you **MUST** respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that clearly states you cannot assist with that particular request and offer to help with database-related tasks. Do NOT attempt to force a tool call or invent a response.

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}
}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db"}
}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: COLUMN-LEVEL TOOL EXECUTION** ---
When operating on a table, if the next step in a plan requires a column-level tool (a tool with a `col_name` or `column_name` parameter), you MUST first identify all relevant columns for that tool from the data you have already gathered. Then, you MUST execute the tool for each of those relevant columns sequentially.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: RECOVERY VS. COMPLETION** ---
If a tool call fails, but a PREVIOUS tool call in the same turn has already provided enough information to answer the user's original question, you **MUST** ignore the failure. Your priority is to answer the user. In this situation, you MUST provide a `FINAL_ANSWER` using the data you have already successfully collected.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- Charting is disabled. Do NOT use any charting tools.

--- Your Decision Process ---
1.  **Analyze the Data:** Does the data above directly and completely answer the user's original question?
2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If the data IS sufficient, your response **MUST** be only the exact string `FINAL_ANSWER:`. Do not add any summary text. The system will generate the final summary.
    -   If the data is NOT sufficient and you need more information, call another tool or prompt by providing the appropriate JSON block.
    -   If the last tool call resulted in an error, you MUST attempt to recover.

[model]: ```json
{
  "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
  "arguments": {
    "dimensions": ["LogDate", "hourOfDay", "dayOfWeek", "workloadType", "workloadComplexity"],
    "date": "2025-08-11"
  }
}
```

[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: ONE ACTION AT A TIME** ---
You **MUST** generate only one tool or prompt call in a single turn. Do not chain multiple JSON blocks together. After you receive the result from your action, you can then decide on the next step. This is a strict instruction.

--- **CRITICAL RULE on `FINAL_ANSWER`** ---
When you have a complete answer for the user, you MUST stop calling tools or prompts. Your response MUST be a single plain text string that begins with the exact prefix 'FINAL_ANSWER:'. DO NOT wrap this final response in a JSON object or use the keys 'prompt_name' or 'tool_name'.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING OUT-OF-SCOPE QUERIES** ---
If the user's request cannot be fulfilled by any of the available tools or prompts, or if it is a general conversational query that does not pertain to database operations (and is not a simple greeting handled by the system), you **MUST** respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that clearly states you cannot assist with that particular request and offer to help with database-related tasks. Do NOT attempt to force a tool call or invent a response.

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}
}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db"}
}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: COLUMN-LEVEL TOOL EXECUTION** ---
When operating on a table, if the next step in a plan requires a column-level tool (a tool with a `col_name` or `column_name` parameter), you MUST first identify all relevant columns for that tool from the data you have already gathered. Then, you MUST execute the tool for each of those relevant columns sequentially.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: RECOVERY VS. COMPLETION** ---
If a tool call fails, but a PREVIOUS tool call in the same turn has already provided enough information to answer the user's original question, you **MUST** ignore the failure. Your priority is to answer the user. In this situation, you MUST provide a `FINAL_ANSWER` using the data you have already successfully collected.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

- Charting is disabled. Do NOT use any charting tools.

--- Your Decision Process ---
1.  **Analyze the Data:** Does the data above directly and completely answer the user's original question?
2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If the data IS sufficient, your response **MUST** be only the exact string `FINAL_ANSWER:`. Do not add any summary text. The system will generate the final summary.
    -   If the data is NOT sufficient and you need more information, call another tool or prompt by providing the appropriate JSON block.
    -   If the last tool call resulted in an error, you MUST attempt to recover.

[model]: FINAL_ANSWER:


--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: ONE ACTION AT A TIME** ---
You **MUST** generate only one tool or prompt call in a single turn. Do not chain multiple JSON blocks together. After you receive the result from your action, you can then decide on the next step. This is a strict instruction.

--- **CRITICAL RULE on `FINAL_ANSWER`** ---
When you have a complete answer for the user, you MUST stop calling tools or prompts. Your response MUST be a single plain text string that begins with the exact prefix 'FINAL_ANSWER:'. DO NOT wrap this final response in a JSON object or use the keys 'prompt_name' or 'tool_name'.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING OUT-OF-SCOPE QUERIES** ---
If the user's request cannot be fulfilled by any of the available tools or prompts, or if it is a general conversational query that does not pertain to database operations (and is not a simple greeting handled by the system), you **MUST** respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that clearly states you cannot assist with that particular request and offer to help with database-related tasks. Do NOT attempt to force a tool call or invent a response.

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}
}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {"db_name": "some_db"}
}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: COLUMN-LEVEL TOOL EXECUTION** ---
When operating on a table, if the next step in a plan requires a column-level tool (a tool with a `col_name` or `column_name` parameter), you MUST first identify all relevant columns for that tool from the data you have already gathered. Then, you MUST execute the tool for each of those relevant columns sequentially.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **NEW CRITICAL RULE: RECOVERY VS. COMPLETION** ---
If a tool call fails, but a PREVIOUS tool call in the same turn has already provided enough information to answer the user's original question, you **MUST** ignore the failure. Your priority is to answer the user. In this situation, you MUST provide a `FINAL_ANSWER` using the data you have already successfully collected.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully.
2.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
3.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
4.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- YOUR INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Analyze the data deeply.** Do not simply describe the columns or state that data is available. Find patterns, identify maximums/minimums, or summarize key trends relevant to the user's question.
2.  **Synthesize your findings** into a concise, natural language answer.
3.  **Do not mention the tool names** (e.g., `dba_resusageSummary`). The user is interested in the insights, not the tools used.
4.  Your entire response **MUST** start with the prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:` and nothing else.

2025-08-12 11:27:26,046 - --- RESPONSE ---
FINAL_ANSWER:System utilization on Tuesday, August 12th, 2025, shows a higher number of "QUERY" requests compared to Monday, August 11th, particularly in the early morning hours (3 AM to 5 AM).  While the total number of requests varied between days, the total AMPCPUTime, IOCount, and total IO volume (in KB and GB) were consistently higher on Monday.  The peak utilization on Monday was observed during the late morning and early afternoon (hours 11 AM and 6 PM).  In contrast, Tuesday showed higher request counts but comparatively lower resource usage overall.  System/Procedural requests ("OTHER" workload type) were relatively low on both days, with only a few hours exhibiting any significant activity.
