2025-07-31 19:12:41,792 - --- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}}
}}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db"}}
}}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

**Another Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Responds with a list of tables, including `Equipment`)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "what is the quality of Equipment?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about the 'Equipment' table. The previous turns established the context of the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I must reuse this database name."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `Equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

**Example of CORRECT Multi-Step Plan:**
    -   USER: "what is the system utilization in number of queries for today?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 1): "The user is asking about 'today'. I do not know the current date. My first step must be to get the current date from the database."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 1):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "base_readQuery",
          "arguments": {{ "sql": "SELECT CURRENT_DATE" }}
        }}
        ```
    -   TOOL RESPONSE (Step 1): `{{"results": [{{"Date": "2025-07-29"}}]}}`
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 2): "The database returned the current date as 2025-07-29. Now I can use this date to answer the user's original question about system utilization."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 2):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
          "arguments": {{ "date": "2025-07-29" }}
        }}
        ```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully. If it indicates an invalid column, parameter, or dimension (e.g., 'Column not found'), identify the specific argument that caused the failure.
2.  **Consult Tool Docs:** Review the documentation for the failed tool that is provided in this system prompt.
3.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Your next thought process should explain the error and propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
4.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
5.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 0a12932f-56ee-4124-bb8d-10a95a697172) ---
[user]: how many databases are on the system?

2025-07-31 19:12:41,792 - --- RESPONSE ---
```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_databaseList"
}
```
--------------------------------------------------

2025-07-31 19:12:42,839 - --- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}}
}}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db"}}
}}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

**Another Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Responds with a list of tables, including `Equipment`)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "what is the quality of Equipment?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about the 'Equipment' table. The previous turns established the context of the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I must reuse this database name."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `Equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

**Example of CORRECT Multi-Step Plan:**
    -   USER: "what is the system utilization in number of queries for today?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 1): "The user is asking about 'today'. I do not know the current date. My first step must be to get the current date from the database."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 1):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "base_readQuery",
          "arguments": {{ "sql": "SELECT CURRENT_DATE" }}
        }}
        ```
    -   TOOL RESPONSE (Step 1): `{{"results": [{{"Date": "2025-07-29"}}]}}`
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 2): "The database returned the current date as 2025-07-29. Now I can use this date to answer the user's original question about system utilization."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 2):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
          "arguments": {{ "date": "2025-07-29" }}
        }}
        ```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully. If it indicates an invalid column, parameter, or dimension (e.g., 'Column not found'), identify the specific argument that caused the failure.
2.  **Consult Tool Docs:** Review the documentation for the failed tool that is provided in this system prompt.
3.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Your next thought process should explain the error and propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
4.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
5.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 0a12932f-56ee-4124-bb8d-10a95a697172) ---
[user]: how many databases are on the system?
[assistant]: ```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_databaseList"
}
```
[user]: You have just received data from a tool call. Review the data and your instructions to decide the next step.

1.  **Consider a Chart:** Review the `--- Charting Rules ---` in your system prompt. Based on the data you just received, would a chart be an appropriate and helpful way to visualize the information for the user?

2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If a chart is appropriate, your next action is to call the correct chart-generation tool. Respond with only a `Thought:` and a ```json...``` block for that tool.
    -   If you still need more information from other tools, call the next appropriate tool by responding with a `Thought:` and a ```json...``` block.
    -   If a chart is **not** appropriate and you have all the information needed to answer the user's request, you **MUST** provide the final answer. Your response **MUST** be plain text that starts with `FINAL_ANSWER:`. **DO NOT** use a JSON block for the final answer.

The last tool execution returned the following result. Use this to inform your next action:

2025-07-31 19:12:42,839 - --- RESPONSE ---
FINAL_ANSWER: There are 50 databases on the system.
--------------------------------------------------

2025-07-31 19:12:49,814 - --- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}}
}}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db"}}
}}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

**Another Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Responds with a list of tables, including `Equipment`)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "what is the quality of Equipment?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about the 'Equipment' table. The previous turns established the context of the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I must reuse this database name."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `Equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

**Example of CORRECT Multi-Step Plan:**
    -   USER: "what is the system utilization in number of queries for today?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 1): "The user is asking about 'today'. I do not know the current date. My first step must be to get the current date from the database."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 1):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "base_readQuery",
          "arguments": {{ "sql": "SELECT CURRENT_DATE" }}
        }}
        ```
    -   TOOL RESPONSE (Step 1): `{{"results": [{{"Date": "2025-07-29"}}]}}`
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 2): "The database returned the current date as 2025-07-29. Now I can use this date to answer the user's original question about system utilization."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 2):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
          "arguments": {{ "date": "2025-07-29" }}
        }}
        ```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully. If it indicates an invalid column, parameter, or dimension (e.g., 'Column not found'), identify the specific argument that caused the failure.
2.  **Consult Tool Docs:** Review the documentation for the failed tool that is provided in this system prompt.
3.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Your next thought process should explain the error and propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
4.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
5.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"

```
--------------------------------------------------

2025-07-31 19:12:50,800 - --- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}}
}}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db"}}
}}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

**Another Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Responds with a list of tables, including `Equipment`)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "what is the quality of Equipment?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about the 'Equipment' table. The previous turns established the context of the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I must reuse this database name."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `Equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

**Example of CORRECT Multi-Step Plan:**
    -   USER: "what is the system utilization in number of queries for today?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 1): "The user is asking about 'today'. I do not know the current date. My first step must be to get the current date from the database."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 1):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "base_readQuery",
          "arguments": {{ "sql": "SELECT CURRENT_DATE" }}
        }}
        ```
    -   TOOL RESPONSE (Step 1): `{{"results": [{{"Date": "2025-07-29"}}]}}`
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 2): "The database returned the current date as 2025-07-29. Now I can use this date to answer the user's original question about system utilization."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 2):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
          "arguments": {{ "date": "2025-07-29" }}
        }}
        ```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully. If it indicates an invalid column, parameter, or dimension (e.g., 'Column not found'), identify the specific argument that caused the failure.
2.  **Consult Tool Docs:** Review the documentation for the failed tool that is provided in this system prompt.
3.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Your next thought process should explain the error and propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
4.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
5.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

[user]: You have just received data from a tool call. Review the data and your instructions to decide the next step.

1.  **Consider a Chart:** Review the `--- Charting Rules ---` in your system prompt. Based on the data you just received, would a chart be an appropriate and helpful way to visualize the information for the user?

2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If a chart is appropriate, your next action is to call the correct chart-generation tool. Respond with only a `Thought:` and a ```json...``` block for that tool.
    -   If you still need more information from other tools, call the next appropriate tool by responding with a `Thought:` and a ```json...``` block.
    -   If a chart is **not** appropriate and you have all the information needed to answer the user's request, you **MUST** provide the final answer. Your response **MUST** be plain text that starts with `FINAL_ANSWER:`. **DO NOT** use a JSON block for the final answer.

The last tool execution returned the following result. Use this to inform your next action:

You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

**Another Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Responds with a list of tables, including `Equipment`)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "what is the quality of Equipment?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about the 'Equipment' table. The previous turns established the context of the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I must reuse this database name."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `Equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

**Example of CORRECT Multi-Step Plan:**
    -   USER: "what is the system utilization in number of queries for today?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 1): "The user is asking about 'today'. I do not know the current date. My first step must be to get the current date from the database."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 1):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "base_readQuery",
          "arguments": {{ "sql": "SELECT CURRENT_DATE" }}
        }}
        ```
    -   TOOL RESPONSE (Step 1): `{{"results": [{{"Date": "2025-07-29"}}]}}`
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 2): "The database returned the current date as 2025-07-29. Now I can use this date to answer the user's original question about system utilization."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 2):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
          "arguments": {{ "date": "2025-07-29" }}
        }}
        ```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully. If it indicates an invalid column, parameter, or dimension (e.g., 'Column not found'), identify the specific argument that caused the failure.
2.  **Consult Tool Docs:** Review the documentation for the failed tool that is provided in this system prompt.
3.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Your next thought process should explain the error and propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
4.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
5.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--------------------------------------------------

2025-07-31 19:13:00,647 - --- SYSTEM PROMPT ---
You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}}
}}

[user]: how many databases are on the system?
[assistant]: ```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_databaseList"
}
```
[user]: what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?
[assistant]: ```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",

[user]: You have just received data from a tool call. Review the data and your instructions to decide the next step.

1.  **Consider a Chart:** Review the `--- Charting Rules ---` in your system prompt. Based on the data you just received, would a chart be an appropriate and helpful way to visualize the information for the user?

2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If a chart is appropriate, your next action is to call the correct chart-generation tool. Respond with only a `Thought:` and a ```json...``` block for that tool.
    -   If you still need more information from other tools, call the next appropriate tool by responding with a `Thought:` and a ```json...``` block.
    -   If a chart is **not** appropriate and you have all the information needed to answer the user's request, you **MUST** provide the final answer. Your response **MUST** be plain text that starts with `FINAL_ANSWER:`. **DO NOT** use a JSON block for the final answer.

The last tool execution returned the following result. Use this to inform your next action:

Thought: The tool call to `qlty_columnSummary` failed because the object 'Equipment' does not exist. I need to inform the user that the table does not exist in the database.

FINAL_ANSWER: The table 'Equipment' does not exist in the database. Please verify the table name and try again.
