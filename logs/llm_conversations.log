SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {{"arg": "value"}}}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {{"arg": "value"}}}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Arguments Over Names.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its arguments. First, identify capabilities that accept arguments matching the entities in the user's request (e.g., if the user provides a `table_name`, you MUST only consider capabilities that accept a `table_name` argument). If you need to perform a direct action or analysis, you MUST select a `tool_name`. Only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks that are explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1.  The user is asking about the quality of a specific **table**.
    2.  The most relevant category is `Data Quality`.
    3.  I must find a capability in that category that accepts a `table_name` argument.
    4.  `qlty_databaseQuality` is a prompt with no arguments, so it is incorrect.
    5.  `qlty_columnSummary` is a tool that accepts `database_name` and `table_name`. This is a perfect match.
- **Correct Response:** `{{ "tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {{ "database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online" }} }}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1.  The user is asking about a specific **database**.
    2.  The most relevant category is `Database Information`.
    3.  I must find a capability that works on a database.
    4.  `base_tableBusinessDesc` requires a `table_name`, so it is incorrect.
    5.  `base_databaseBusinessDesc` is a prompt that accepts a `database_name`. This is a perfect match.
- **Correct Response:** `{{ "prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {{ "database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db" }} }}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.

USER PROMPT:
what i the quality for table online in database demo_customer360_db?
[model]: ```json
{
    "tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary",
    "arguments": {
        "database_name": "demo_customer360_db",
        "table_name": "online"
    }
}
```

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {{"arg": "value"}}}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {{"arg": "value"}}}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Arguments Over Names.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its arguments. First, identify capabilities that accept arguments matching the entities in the user's request (e.g., if the user provides a `table_name`, you MUST only consider capabilities that accept a `table_name` argument). If you need to perform a direct action or analysis, you MUST select a `tool_name`. Only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks that are explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1.  The user is asking about the quality of a specific **table**.
    2.  The most relevant category is `Data Quality`.
    3.  I must find a capability in that category that accepts a `table_name` argument.
    4.  `qlty_databaseQuality` is a prompt with no arguments, so it is incorrect.
    5.  `qlty_columnSummary` is a tool that accepts `database_name` and `table_name`. This is a perfect match.
- **Correct Response:** `{{ "tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {{ "database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online" }} }}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1.  The user is asking about a specific **database**.
    2.  The most relevant category is `Database Information`.
    3.  I must find a capability that works on a database.
    4.  `base_tableBusinessDesc` requires a `table_name`, so it is incorrect.
    5.  `base_databaseBusinessDesc` is a prompt that accepts a `database_name`. This is a perfect match.
- **Correct Response:** `{{ "prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {{ "database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db" }} }}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.

--- Your Decision Process ---
1.  **Analyze the situation:** Your primary goal is to gather all necessary data to comprehensively answer the user's original question. You may need to call several tools in sequence.
2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If you need more information to answer the question, call another tool or prompt by providing the appropriate JSON block.
    -   If you are confident that you have now gathered **all** the necessary data from this and any previous tool calls, your response **MUST** be only the exact string `SYSTEM_ACTION_COMPLETE`. This will signal the final report writer to begin.
    -   If the last tool call resulted in an error, you MUST attempt to recover by calling a corrected tool.

2025-08-16 14:10:53,362 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 62942aaa-06c7-4244-9105-45941e07fa8a) ---
--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Generating final summary from collected tool data.

--- History ---
[user]: You are a helpful assistant.
[model]: Understood.
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {{"arg": "value"}}}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {{"arg": "value"}}}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Arguments Over Names.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its arguments. First, identify capabilities that accept arguments matching the entities in the user's request (e.g., if the user provides a `table_name`, you MUST only consider capabilities that accept a `table_name` argument). If you need to perform a direct action or analysis, you MUST select a `tool_name`. Only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks that are explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1.  The user is asking about the quality of a specific **table**.
    2.  The most relevant category is `Data Quality`.
    3.  I must find a capability in that category that accepts a `table_name` argument.
    4.  `qlty_databaseQuality` is a prompt with no arguments, so it is incorrect.
    5.  `qlty_columnSummary` is a tool that accepts `database_name` and `table_name`. This is a perfect match.
- **Correct Response:** `{{ "tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {{ "database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online" }} }}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1.  The user is asking about a specific **database**.
    2.  The most relevant category is `Database Information`.
    3.  I must find a capability that works on a database.
    4.  `base_tableBusinessDesc` requires a `table_name`, so it is incorrect.
    5.  `base_databaseBusinessDesc` is a prompt that accepts a `database_name`. This is a perfect match.
- **Correct Response:** `{{ "prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {{ "database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db" }} }}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.

USER PROMPT:
what i the quality for table online in database demo_customer360_db?
[model]: ```json

    }
}
```
[user]: SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {{"arg": "value"}}}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {{"arg": "value"}}}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Arguments Over Names.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its arguments. First, identify capabilities that accept arguments matching the entities in the user's request (e.g., if the user provides a `table_name`, you MUST only consider capabilities that accept a `table_name` argument). If you need to perform a direct action or analysis, you MUST select a `tool_name`. Only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks that are explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1.  The user is asking about the quality of a specific **table**.
    2.  The most relevant category is `Data Quality`.
    3.  I must find a capability in that category that accepts a `table_name` argument.
    4.  `qlty_databaseQuality` is a prompt with no arguments, so it is incorrect.
    5.  `qlty_columnSummary` is a tool that accepts `database_name` and `table_name`. This is a perfect match.
- **Correct Response:** `{{ "tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {{ "database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online" }} }}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1.  The user is asking about a specific **database**.
    2.  The most relevant category is `Database Information`.
    3.  I must find a capability that works on a database.
    4.  `base_tableBusinessDesc` requires a `table_name`, so it is incorrect.
    5.  `base_databaseBusinessDesc` is a prompt that accepts a `database_name`. This is a perfect match.
- **Correct Response:** `{{ "prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {{ "database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db" }} }}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.

    -   If you are confident that you have now gathered **all** the necessary data from this and any previous tool calls, your response **MUST** be only the exact string `SYSTEM_ACTION_COMPLETE`. This will signal the final report writer to begin.
    -   If the last tool call resulted in an error, you MUST attempt to recover by calling a corrected tool.

[model]: SYSTEM_ACTION_COMPLETE


--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {{"arg": "value"}}}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {{"arg": "value"}}}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Arguments Over Names.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its arguments. First, identify capabilities that accept arguments matching the entities in the user's request (e.g., if the user provides a `table_name`, you MUST only consider capabilities that accept a `table_name` argument). If you need to perform a direct action or analysis, you MUST select a `tool_name`. Only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks that are explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Few-Shot Examples
Here are examples of the correct thinking process:

**Example 1:**
- **User Query:** "what is the quality of table 'online' in database 'DEMO_Customer360_db'?"
- **Thought Process:**
    1.  The user is asking about the quality of a specific **table**.
    2.  The most relevant category is `Data Quality`.
    3.  I must find a capability in that category that accepts a `table_name` argument.
    4.  `qlty_databaseQuality` is a prompt with no arguments, so it is incorrect.
    5.  `qlty_columnSummary` is a tool that accepts `database_name` and `table_name`. This is a perfect match.
- **Correct Response:** `{{ "tool_name": "qlty_columnSummary", "arguments": {{ "database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "online" }} }}`

**Example 2:**
- **User Query:** "describe the business purpose of the 'DEMO_Customer360_db' database"
- **Thought Process:**
    1.  The user is asking about a specific **database**.
    2.  The most relevant category is `Database Information`.
    3.  I must find a capability that works on a database.
    4.  `base_tableBusinessDesc` requires a `table_name`, so it is incorrect.
    5.  `base_databaseBusinessDesc` is a prompt that accepts a `database_name`. This is a perfect match.
- **Correct Response:** `{{ "prompt_name": "base_databaseBusinessDesc", "arguments": {{ "database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db" }} }}`

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.

1.  **Adopt the Persona of a Data Analyst:** Your goal is to provide a holistic analysis and deliver actionable insights, not just report numbers.
2.  **Go Beyond the Obvious:** Start with the primary findings (like data completeness or null counts), but then scrutinize the data for secondary insights, patterns, or anomalies. For a data quality assessment, this could include looking for unexpected distributions, a lack of negative values in numeric columns where appropriate, or other indicators of high-quality data.
3.  **Structure Your Answer:** Begin with a high-level summary that directly answers the user's question. Then, if applicable, use bullet points to highlight key, specific observations from the data.
4.  **CRITICAL:** Your entire response **MUST** begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by your natural language summary. Do not add any other text before this prefix.

FINAL_ANSWER: The data quality for the 'online' table in the 'demo_customer360_db' database appears to be very high based on the column summaries. Every column has 100% non-null values, indicating complete data for all 70 rows.

Here's a summary of key observations:

*   **Completeness:** All columns have 100% NonNullPercentage, meaning there are no missing values in any of the columns. This is a strong indicator of data completeness.
*   **Data Types:** The table contains a mix of VARCHAR and INTEGER/SMALLINT data types, which seem appropriate for the column names (e.g., VARCHAR for names and addresses, INTEGER for loyalty numbers and zip codes, and SMALLINT for online LTV).
*   **Potential Further Analysis:** While the data is complete, further data quality checks could include:
    *   **Data Validation:** Ensuring that the values within each column conform to expected formats or ranges (e.g., ZIP codes are valid, state abbreviations are correct).
    *   **Uniqueness Checks:** Verifying that unique identifiers (like loyalty numbers or email addresses) are indeed unique.
    *   **Business Logic Validation:** Checking if the data adheres to specific business rules (e.g., online lifetime value falls within a reasonable range).
