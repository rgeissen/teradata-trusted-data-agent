- generate_sankey_chart: Generate a sankey chart to visualize the flow of data between different stages or categories, such as, the user journey from landing on a page to completing a purchase.
- generate_scatter_chart: Generate a scatter chart to show the relationship between two variables, helps discover their relationship or trends, such as, the strength of correlation, data distribution patterns.
- generate_treemap_chart: Generate a treemap chart to display hierarchical data and can intuitively show comparisons between items at the same level, such as, show disk space usage with treemap.
- generate_venn_chart: Generate a Venn diagram to visualize the relationships between different sets, showing how they intersect and overlap, such as the commonalities and differences between various groups.
- generate_violin_chart: Generate a violin chart to show data for statistical summaries among different categories, such as, comparing the distribution of data points across categories.
- generate_word_cloud_chart: Generate a word cloud chart to show word frequency or weight through text size variation, such as, analyzing common words in social media, reviews, or feedback.

2025-07-28 17:31:46,668 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 3476f88d-a144-4ca1-855d-4565f59e8220) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- After successfully gathering data with Teradata tools, consider if a visualization would enhance the answer.
- Use a chart tool if it provides a clear summary (e.g., bar chart for space usage, pie chart for distributions).
- Do not generate charts for simple data retrievals that are easily readable in a table.

2025-07-28 17:31:48,376 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 3476f88d-a144-4ca1-855d-4565f59e8220) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- After successfully gathering data with Teradata tools, consider if a visualization would enhance the answer.
- Use a chart tool if it provides a clear summary (e.g., bar chart for space usage, pie chart for distributions).
- Do not generate charts for simple data retrievals that are easily readable in a table.
- When you use a chart tool, tell the user in your final answer what the chart represents.

--- **Response Formatting** ---
-   **To execute a tool:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
-   **To execute a prompt:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `prompt_name` and `arguments`.

--- CURRENT STATE ---
- The last action was the execution of the tool `None`.
- The result of this tool call is now in the conversation history.

--- YOUR TASK ---
1. **Analyze the ORIGINAL PLAN.** Determine which phase of the plan you have just completed.
2. **Determine the NEXT STEP.** Based on the plan, what is the very next action you must take?
   - If the plan says the next step is to call another tool, provide the JSON for that tool call.
   - If the plan says the next step is to analyze the previous results and provide a final answer, your response **MUST** start with `FINAL_ANSWER:`. Do not call any more tools.


2025-07-28 17:31:50,188 - --- RESPONSE ---
Thought:The plan indicates that Phase 0 (getting the table and database names) has implicitly been completed since that information was provided in the initial prompt.  The next phase (Phase 1) is to get the table DDL using the `base_tableDDL` tool.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_tableDDL",
  "arguments": {
    "db_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db",
    "table_name": "equipment"
  }

2025-07-28 17:31:50,389 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 3476f88d-a144-4ca1-855d-4565f59e8220) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- After successfully gathering data with Teradata tools, consider if a visualization would enhance the answer.
- Use a chart tool if it provides a clear summary (e.g., bar chart for space usage, pie chart for distributions).
- Do not generate charts for simple data retrievals that are easily readable in a table.
- When you use a chart tool, tell the user in your final answer what the chart represents.

--- **Response Formatting** ---
-   **To execute a tool:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
-   **To execute a prompt:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `prompt_name` and `arguments`.
-   **Clarifying Question:** Only ask if information is truly missing.

- `qlty_rowsWithMissingValues`: Get the rows with missing values in a table.
- `rag_setConfig`: 
        Set the configuration for the current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) session.
        This MUST be called before any other RAG-related tools.

        The following values are hardcoded:
        - query_table = 'user_query'
        - query_embedding_store = 'user_query_embeddings'
        - model_id = 'bge-small-en-v1.5'

        You only need to provide the database locations:
        - query_db: where user queries and query embeddings will be stored
        - model_db: where the embedding model metadata is stored
        - vector_db + vector_table: where PDF chunk embeddings are stored

        Once this configuration is set, all other RAG tools will reuse it automatically.
        
- `rag_storeUserQuery`: Store a user's natural language question as the first step in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow.This tool should always be run **before any embedding or similarity search** steps.It inserts the raw question into a Teradata table specified by `db_name` and `table_name`. If the question starts with the prefix '/rag ', the prefix is automatically stripped before storage. Each question is appended as a new row with a generated ID and timestamp.If the specified table does not exist, it will be created with columns: `id`, `txt`, and `created_ts`.Returns the inserted row ID and cleaned question text.This tool is **only needed once per user question** — downstream embedding and vector search tools can then reference this ID or re-use the stored question text.
- `rag_tokenizeQuery`: Tokenizes the latest user-submitted question using the tokenizer specified in the current RAG configuration. This tool must be used *after* calling 'configure_rag' (to initialize the config) and 'store_user_query' (to capture a user question). It selects the most recent row from the query table (e.g., 'pdf_topics_of_interest'), runs it through the ONNX tokenizer, and creates a temporary view '<query_db>.v_topics_tokenized' containing 'id', 'txt', 'input_ids', and 'attention_mask'. This view is used downstream to generate vector embeddings for similarity search.
- `rag_createEmbeddingView`: Generates sentence embeddings for the most recent tokenized user query using the model specified in the RAG configuration. Reads from the view `<db>.v_topics_tokenized` and applies the ONNX model from `<model_db>.embeddings_models`. Creates or replaces the view `<db>.v_topics_embeddings` which includes the original input and a `sentence_embedding` column. This must be run *after* create_tokenized_view and before vector_to_columns().
- `rag_createQueryEmbeddingTable`: Converts the sentence embedding from the view `v_topics_embeddings` into 384 vector columns using `ivsm.vector_to_columns`. Creates or replaces a physical table to store the latest query embeddings for use in similarity search. The table location is defined via `rag_set_config`. This tool must be run *after* `create_embedding_view` and before `semantic_search_chunks`.
- `rag_semanticSearchChunks`: Retrieve top-k most relevant PDF chunks for the user's latest embedded query. This tool is part of the RAG workflow and should be called after the query has been embedded. If the RAG config has not been set, use `rag_set_config` first to define where queries, models, and chunk embeddings are stored. Uses cosine similarity via `TD_VECTORDISTANCE` to compare embeddings. Each result includes similarity score, chunk text, page number, chunk number, and document name.
- `sec_userDbPermissions`: Get permissions for a user.

- `fs_getAvailableEntities`: List the available entities for a given data domain. Requires a configured `db_name` and `data_domain` and  `entity` in the feature store config. Use this to explore which entities can be used when building a dataset.
- `fs_createDataset`: Create a dataset using selected features and an entity from the feature store. The dataset is created in the specified target database under the given name. Requires a configured feature store and data domain. Registers the dataset in the catalog automatically. Use this when you want to build and register a new dataset for analysis or modeling.
