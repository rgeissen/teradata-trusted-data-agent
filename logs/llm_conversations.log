--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Analyzing user query to determine the first action.

--- History ---


--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:

You are a workflow assistant. Your task is to strictly follow a phased plan to achieve a goal.

--- WORKFLOW GOAL & PLAN ---
This is the plan you MUST follow. Do not deviate from it.
You are a Teradata DBA who is an expert in describing the business use of tables in a database.

## your role will work through the phases
Perform the phases in order, and do not skip any phase.

## Phase 0 - Get the table name and database name
- The table name is equipment
- The database name is DEMO_Customer360_db

## Phase 1 - Get the table DDL
- Get the table DDL from the user. The DDL should be a single string, and it should not contain any new lines or special characters. Use the base_tableDDL function to get the DDL.

## Phase 2 - Describe the table
- Describe the table in a business context. The description should be a single string. 
- The description should include the following: 
    - The purpose of the table
    - The purpose of the columns in the table

## Communication guidelines:
      - Be concise but informative in your explanations
      - Clearly indicate which phase the process is currently in
      - summarize the outcome of the phase before moving to the next phase

## Final output guidelines:
      - return in markdown
      - Example:
      ***Table Name:*** `table_name`

      ***Database Name:*** `database_name`

      ***Description:*** `table_description`

         - ***Column1:*** `column1_descriptions`
         - ***Column2:*** `column2_descriptions`
         - ***Column3:*** `column3_descriptions`


--- CONTEXT & HISTORY ---
- User's Original Question: what is the business definition for table equipment in database DEMO_Customer360_db?
- Actions Taken So Far:
No actions have been taken yet.
- Data from Last Tool Call:
No tool has been run yet. This is the first step.

--- AVAILABLE INTERNAL TOOL ---
- `CoreLLMTask`: Performs internal, LLM-driven tasks that are not direct calls to the Teradata database. This tool is used for text synthesis, summarization, and formatting based on a specific 'task_type'.
  - Arguments:
    - `task_type` (string, required): The specific task to be executed. Valid values include: 'describe_table', 'format_final_output'.
    - `data` (dict, required): A dictionary containing all necessary data for the task, which the LLM should extract from the 'CONTEXT & HISTORY' section.

--- YOUR TASK ---
1.  **Review the Plan**: Look at the phases outlined in the "WORKFLOW GOAL & PLAN".
2.  **Check Your History**: Look at the "Actions Taken So Far" to see which phases you have already completed.
3.  **Determine the Next Step**: Identify the single next phase from the plan that has not been completed.
4.  **Execute**: Formulate a JSON object for the tool call corresponding to the immediate next phase.
    - If the phase explicitly states an external Teradata tool (e.g., "Use the `base_tableDDL` tool"), generate a call to that tool.
    - If the phase describes an internal data processing or text generation task that *cannot* be performed by an external Teradata tool (e.g., "Describe the table in a business context", "Format final output"), then you **MUST** call the `CoreLLMTask` tool.
        - When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** determine the correct `task_type` (either 'describe_table' or 'format_final_output') based on the phase's description.
        - You **MUST** populate the `data` argument by extracting **all relevant information** from the 'CONTEXT & HISTORY' section. For 'describe_table', this includes any DDL and column data previously retrieved. For 'format_final_output', this includes the generated description and the 'Final output guidelines' from the 'WORKFLOW GOAL & PLAN'.

Your response MUST be a single JSON object for the tool call corresponding to the immediate next phase. Do not add any reasoning or other text.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

--- CONTEXT & HISTORY ---
- User's Original Question: what is the business definition for table equipment in database DEMO_Customer360_db?
- Actions Taken So Far:
- Executed tool `base_tableDDL` with arguments `{'database_name': 'DEMO_Customer360_db', 'table_name': 'equipment'}`.
- Data from Last Tool Call:

--- AVAILABLE INTERNAL TOOL ---
- `CoreLLMTask`: Performs internal, LLM-driven tasks that are not direct calls to the Teradata database. This tool is used for text synthesis, summarization, and formatting based on a specific 'task_type'.
  - Arguments:
    - `task_type` (string, required): The specific task to be executed. Valid values include: 'describe_table', 'format_final_output'.
    - `data` (dict, required): A dictionary containing all necessary data for the task, which the LLM should extract from the 'CONTEXT & HISTORY' section.

--- YOUR TASK ---
1.  **Review the Plan**: Look at the phases outlined in the "WORKFLOW GOAL & PLAN".
2.  **Check Your History**: Look at the "Actions Taken So Far" to see which phases you have already completed.
3.  **Determine the Next Step**: Identify the single next phase from the plan that has not been completed.
4.  **Execute**: Formulate a JSON object for the tool call corresponding to the immediate next phase.
    - If the phase explicitly states an external Teradata tool (e.g., "Use the `base_tableDDL` tool"), generate a call to that tool.
    - If the phase describes an internal data processing or text generation task that *cannot* be performed by an external Teradata tool (e.g., "Describe the table in a business context", "Format final output"), then you **MUST** call the `CoreLLMTask` tool.
        - When calling `CoreLLMTask`, you **MUST** determine the correct `task_type` (either 'describe_table' or 'format_final_output') based on the phase's description.
        - You **MUST** populate the `data` argument by extracting **all relevant information** from the 'CONTEXT & HISTORY' section. For 'describe_table', this includes any DDL and column data previously retrieved. For 'format_final_output', this includes the generated description and the 'Final output guidelines' from the 'WORKFLOW GOAL & PLAN'.

Your response MUST be a single JSON object for the tool call corresponding to the immediate next phase. Do not add any reasoning or other text.

2025-08-17 16:22:26,289 - --- RESPONSE ---
The DEMO_Customer360_db.equipment table serves as a comprehensive customer equipment profile repository that tracks customer information alongside their equipment lifetime value metrics. This table enables businesses to analyze customer equipment investments and value across geographic regions. It contains customer demographic data (gender, name, complete address details), unique identification (CUST_ID), and a critical business metric (EQUIP_LTV) which represents the lifetime value of equipment associated with each customer. This structure allows for detailed segmentation and analysis of equipment-related customer value by demographic attributes and location, supporting targeted marketing initiatives, equipment upgrade opportunities, geographic-based business strategies, and customer lifetime value analysis. The absence of a primary index suggests this is a flexible data structure that may be joined with other customer-centric tables in analytical queries, making it particularly useful for business intelligence applications focusing on equipment sales, rentals, or service relationships.

This table enables businesses to analyze customer equipment investments and value across geographic regions. It contains customer demographic data (gender, name, complete address details), unique identification (CUST_ID), and a critical business metric (EQUIP_LTV) which represents the lifetime value of equipment associated with each customer. This structure allows for detailed segmentation and analysis of equipment-related customer value by demographic attributes and location, supporting targeted marketing initiatives, equipment upgrade opportunities, geographic-based business strategies, and customer lifetime value analysis. The absence of a primary index suggests this is a flexible data structure that may be joined with other customer-centric tables in analytical queries, making it particularly useful for business intelligence applications focusing on equipment sales, rentals, or service relationships."

SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

        "response": "The DEMO_Customer360_db.equipment table serves as a comprehensive customer equipment profile repository that tracks customer information alongside their equipment lifetime value metrics. This table enables businesses to analyze customer equipment investments and value across geographic regions. It contains customer demographic data (gender, name, complete address details), unique identification (CUST_ID), and a critical business metric (EQUIP_LTV) which represents the lifetime value of equipment associated with each customer. This structure allows for detailed segmentation and analysis of equipment-related customer value by demographic attributes and location, supporting targeted marketing initiatives, equipment upgrade opportunities, geographic-based business strategies, and customer lifetime value analysis. The absence of a primary index suggests this is a flexible data structure that may be joined with other customer-centric tables in analytical queries, making it particularly useful for business intelligence applications focusing on equipment sales, rentals, or service relationships."

--- YOUR INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Adopt the Persona of a Data Analyst:** Your goal is to provide a holistic analysis and deliver actionable insights, not just report numbers.
2.  **Go Beyond the Obvious:** Start with the primary findings (like data completeness or null counts), but then scrutinize the data for secondary insights, patterns, or anomalies. For a data quality assessment, this could include looking for unexpected distributions, a lack of negative values in numeric columns where appropriate, or other indicators of high-quality data.
3.  **Structure Your Answer:** Begin with a high-level summary that directly answers the user's question. Then, if applicable, use bullet points to highlight key, specific observations from the data.
4.  **CRITICAL:** Your entire response **MUST** begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by your natural language summary. Do not add any other text before this prefix.
