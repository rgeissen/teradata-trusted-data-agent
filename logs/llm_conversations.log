--- Prompt ---
You are a helpful assistant that organizes a list of data visualization tools into logical categories for a user interface. Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object. The keys should be the category names (e.g., 'Bar & Column', 'Pie & Donut', 'Line & Area'), and the values should be an array of tool names belonging to that category.

--- Chart Tool List ---
- generate_area_chart: Generate a area chart to show data trends under continuous independent variables and observe the overall data trend, such as, displacement = velocity (average or instantaneous) × time: s = v × t. If the x-axis is time (t) and the y-axis is velocity (v) at each moment, an area chart allows you to observe the trend of velocity over time and infer the distance traveled by the area's size.
- generate_bar_chart: Generate a horizontal bar chart to show data for numerical comparisons among different categories, such as, comparing categorical data and for horizontal comparisons.
- generate_boxplot_chart: Generate a boxplot chart to show data for statistical summaries among different categories, such as, comparing the distribution of data points across categories.
- generate_column_chart: Generate a column chart, which are best for comparing categorical data, such as, when values are close, column charts are preferable because our eyes are better at judging height than other visual elements like area or angles.
- generate_district_map: Generates regional distribution maps, which are usually used to show the administrative divisions and coverage of a dataset. It is not suitable for showing the distribution of specific locations, such as urban administrative divisions, GDP distribution maps of provinces and cities across the country, etc. This tool is limited to generating data maps within China.
- generate_dual_axes_chart: Generate a dual axes chart which is a combination chart that integrates two different chart types, typically combining a bar chart with a line chart to display both the trend and comparison of data, such as, the trend of sales and profit over time.
- generate_fishbone_diagram: Generate a fishbone diagram chart to uses a fish skeleton, like structure to display the causes or effects of a core problem, with the problem as the fish head and the causes/effects as the fish bones. It suits problems that can be split into multiple related factors.
- generate_flow_diagram: Generate a flow diagram chart to show the steps and decision points of a process or system, such as, scenarios requiring linear process presentation.
- generate_funnel_chart: Generate a funnel chart to visualize the progressive reduction of data as it passes through stages, such as, the conversion rates of users from visiting a website to completing a purchase.
- generate_histogram_chart: Generate a histogram chart to show the frequency of data points within a certain range. It can observe data distribution, such as, normal and skewed distributions, and identify data concentration areas and extreme points.
- generate_line_chart: Generate a line chart to show trends over time, such as, the ratio of Apple computer sales to Apple's profits changed from 2000 to 2016.
- generate_liquid_chart: Generate a liquid chart to visualize a single value as a percentage, such as, the current occupancy rate of a reservoir or the completion percentage of a project.

2025-08-05 12:12:17,739 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 47ef25b6-5bdd-4374-bf48-9ed005547fe9) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}}
}}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db"}}
}}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

**Another Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Responds with a list of tables, including `Equipment`)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "what is the quality of Equipment?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about the 'Equipment' table. The previous turns established the context of the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I must reuse this database name."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `Equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

**Example of CORRECT Multi-Step Plan:**
    -   USER: "what is the system utilization in number of queries for today?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 1): "The user is asking about 'today'. I do not know the current date. My first step must be to get the current date from the database."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 1):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "base_readQuery",
          "arguments": {{ "sql": "SELECT CURRENT_DATE" }}
        }}
        ```
    -   TOOL RESPONSE (Step 1): `{{"results": [{{"Date": "2025-07-29"}}]}}`
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 2): "The database returned the current date as 2025-07-29. Now I can use this date to answer the user's original question about system utilization."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 2):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
          "arguments": {{ "date": "2025-07-29" }}
        }}
        ```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of INCORRECT formatting:**
FINAL_ANSWER: Here is the data:
| col1 | col2 |
|------|------|
| val1 | val2 |

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully. If it indicates an invalid column, parameter, or dimension (e.g., 'Column not found'), identify the specific argument that caused the failure.
2.  **Consult Tool Docs:** Review the documentation for the failed tool that is provided in this system prompt.
3.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Your next thought process should explain the error and propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
4.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
5.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- After successfully gathering data with Teradata tools, consider if a visualization would enhance the answer.
- Use a chart tool if it provides a clear summary (e.g., bar chart for space usage, pie chart for distributions).
- Do not generate charts for simple data retrievals that are easily readable in a table.
- When you use a chart tool, tell the user in your final answer what the chart represents.

2025-08-05 12:12:22,094 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 47ef25b6-5bdd-4374-bf48-9ed005547fe9) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool or prompt.

--- **CRITICAL RESPONSE PROTOCOL** ---
Your primary task is to select a single capability to fulfill the user's request. You have two lists of capabilities available: `--- Available Prompts ---` and `--- Available Tools ---`.

1.  **CHOOSE ONE CAPABILITY:** First, review both lists and select the single best capability (either a prompt or a tool) that can fulfill the user's request. If a prompt can solve the entire request, you MUST choose the prompt.

2.  **IDENTIFY THE SOURCE:** Determine which list the chosen capability came from.

3.  **GENERATE RESPONSE JSON:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. The key you use in this JSON object depends entirely on the source list of your chosen capability:
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Prompts ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If your chosen capability is from the `--- Available Tools ---` list, you **MUST** use the key `"tool_name"`.

**This is not a suggestion. It is a strict rule. Using `tool_name` for a prompt, or `prompt_name` for a tool, will cause a critical system failure.**

**Example for a Prompt:**
```json
{{
  "prompt_name": "base_tableBusinessDesc",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db", "table_name": "some_table"}}
}}
```

**Example for a Tool:**
```json
{{
  "tool_name": "base_tableList",
  "arguments": {{"db_name": "some_db"}}
}}
```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

**Another Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Responds with a list of tables, including `Equipment`)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "what is the quality of Equipment?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about the 'Equipment' table. The previous turns established the context of the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I must reuse this database name."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `Equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

**Example of CORRECT Multi-Step Plan:**
    -   USER: "what is the system utilization in number of queries for today?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 1): "The user is asking about 'today'. I do not know the current date. My first step must be to get the current date from the database."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 1):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "base_readQuery",
          "arguments": {{ "sql": "SELECT CURRENT_DATE" }}
        }}
        ```
    -   TOOL RESPONSE (Step 1): `{{"results": [{{"Date": "2025-07-29"}}]}}`
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 2): "The database returned the current date as 2025-07-29. Now I can use this date to answer the user's original question about system utilization."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 2):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
          "arguments": {{ "date": "2025-07-29" }}
        }}
        ```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: DATA PRESENTATION** ---
When a tool returns data (like a list of tables or sample rows), your `FINAL_ANSWER` **MUST NOT** re-format that data into a Markdown table or list. The user interface has a dedicated component for displaying raw data. Your role is to provide a brief, natural language summary or introduction.

**Example of INCORRECT formatting:**
FINAL_ANSWER: Here is the data:
| col1 | col2 |
|------|------|
| val1 | val2 |

**Example of CORRECT summary:**
FINAL_ANSWER: The tool returned 5 rows of sample data for the 'Equipment' table, which is displayed below.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully. If it indicates an invalid column, parameter, or dimension (e.g., 'Column not found'), identify the specific argument that caused the failure.
2.  **Consult Tool Docs:** Review the documentation for the failed tool that is provided in this system prompt.
3.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Your next thought process should explain the error and propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
4.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
5.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- After successfully gathering data with Teradata tools, consider if a visualization would enhance the answer.
- Use a chart tool if it provides a clear summary (e.g., bar chart for space usage, pie chart for distributions).
- Do not generate charts for simple data retrievals that are easily readable in a table.
- When you use a chart tool, tell the user in your final answer what the chart represents.

--- Current User Prompt ---
You have just received data from a tool call. Review the data and your instructions to decide the next step.

1.  **Consider a Chart:** Review the `--- Charting Rules ---` in your system prompt. Based on the data you just received, would a chart be an appropriate and helpful way to visualize the information for the user?

2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If a chart is appropriate, your next action is to call the correct chart-generation tool. Respond with only a `Thought:` and a ```json...``` block for that tool.
    -   If you still need more information from other tools, call the next appropriate tool by responding with a `Thought:` and a ```json...``` block.
    -   If a chart is **not** appropriate and you have all the information needed to answer the user's request, you **MUST** provide the final answer. Your response **MUST** be plain text that starts with `FINAL_ANSWER:`. **DO NOT** use a JSON block for the final answer.

The last tool execution returned the following result. Use this to inform your next action:

Thought:The data includes many metrics across multiple days, hours, workload types, and complexities. A chart would be a useful way to visualize this data and make it easier for the user to understand the system utilization.  However, charting is currently disabled.

FINAL_ANSWER:The system resource usage summary for the last week shows a total of 45 data points aggregated by date, hour of day, day of week, workload type, and workload complexity.  The data includes metrics such as request count, CPU time, IO count, and server byte count.  This detailed breakdown is available for review.
