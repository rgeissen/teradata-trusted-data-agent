2025-07-30 11:23:38,724 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: c31e0f18-20e8-4fae-a89a-a4f870ed973d) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

**Example of CORRECT Multi-Step Plan:**
    -   USER: "what is the system utilization in number of queries for today?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 1): "The user is asking about 'today'. I do not know the current date. My first step must be to get the current date from the database."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 1):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "base_readQuery",
          "arguments": {{ "sql": "SELECT CURRENT_DATE" }}
        }}
        ```
    -   TOOL RESPONSE (Step 1): `{{"results": [{{"Date": "2025-07-29"}}]}}`
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 2): "The database returned the current date as 2025-07-29. Now I can use this date to answer the user's original question about system utilization."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 2):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
          "arguments": {{ "date": "2025-07-29" }}
        }}
        ```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully. If it indicates an invalid column, parameter, or dimension (e.g., 'Column not found'), identify the specific argument that caused the failure.
2.  **Consult Tool Docs:** Review the documentation for the failed tool that is provided in this system prompt.
3.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Your next thought process should explain the error and propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
4.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
5.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- Charting is disabled. Do NOT use any charting tools.

--- **Response Formatting** ---
-   **To execute a tool:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
-   **To execute a prompt:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `prompt_name` and `arguments`.
-   **Clarifying Question:** Only ask if information is truly missing.

[model]: Understood. I will follow all instructions.

--- Current User Prompt ---
which databases are on the system?

2025-07-30 11:23:39,490 - --- RESPONSE ---
Thought: To get a list of databases, I will use the `base_databaseList` tool.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "base_databaseList",
  "arguments": {}
}
```
--------------------------------------------------

2025-07-30 11:23:39,758 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: c31e0f18-20e8-4fae-a89a-a4f870ed973d) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

**Example of CORRECT Multi-Step Plan:**
    -   USER: "what is the system utilization in number of queries for today?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 1): "The user is asking about 'today'. I do not know the current date. My first step must be to get the current date from the database."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 1):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "base_readQuery",
          "arguments": {{ "sql": "SELECT CURRENT_DATE" }}
        }}
        ```
    -   TOOL RESPONSE (Step 1): `{{"results": [{{"Date": "2025-07-29"}}]}}`
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 2): "The database returned the current date as 2025-07-29. Now I can use this date to answer the user's original question about system utilization."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 2):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
          "arguments": {{ "date": "2025-07-29" }}
        }}
        ```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully. If it indicates an invalid column, parameter, or dimension (e.g., 'Column not found'), identify the specific argument that caused the failure.
2.  **Consult Tool Docs:** Review the documentation for the failed tool that is provided in this system prompt.
3.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Your next thought process should explain the error and propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
4.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
5.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- Charting is disabled. Do NOT use any charting tools.

--- **Response Formatting** ---
-   **To execute a tool:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
-   **To execute a prompt:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `prompt_name` and `arguments`.
-   **Clarifying Question:** Only ask if information is truly missing.

--- Current User Prompt ---
You have just received data from a tool call. Review the data and your instructions to decide the next step.

1.  **Consider a Chart:** First, review the `--- Charting Rules ---` in your system prompt. Based on the data you just received, would a chart be an appropriate and helpful way to visualize the information for the user?

2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If a chart is appropriate, your next action is to call the correct chart-generation tool. Respond with only the `Thought:` and ```json...``` block for that tool.
    -   If a chart is **not** appropriate and you have all the information needed to answer the user's request, you should provide the final answer. Your response **MUST** start with `FINAL_ANSWER:`.
    -   If you still need more information from other tools, call the next appropriate tool.

2025-07-30 11:23:48,274 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: c31e0f18-20e8-4fae-a89a-a4f870ed973d) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

**Example of CORRECT Multi-Step Plan:**
    -   USER: "what is the system utilization in number of queries for today?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 1): "The user is asking about 'today'. I do not know the current date. My first step must be to get the current date from the database."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 1):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "base_readQuery",
          "arguments": {{ "sql": "SELECT CURRENT_DATE" }}
        }}
        ```
    -   TOOL RESPONSE (Step 1): `{{"results": [{{"Date": "2025-07-29"}}]}}`
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 2): "The database returned the current date as 2025-07-29. Now I can use this date to answer the user's original question about system utilization."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 2):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
          "arguments": {{ "date": "2025-07-29" }}
        }}
        ```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully. If it indicates an invalid column, parameter, or dimension (e.g., 'Column not found'), identify the specific argument that caused the failure.
2.  **Consult Tool Docs:** Review the documentation for the failed tool that is provided in this system prompt.
3.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Your next thought process should explain the error and propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
4.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
5.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- Charting is disabled. Do NOT use any charting tools.

--- **Response Formatting** ---
-   **To execute a tool:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `tool_name` and `arguments`.
-   **To execute a prompt:** Respond with 'Thought:' explaining your choice, followed by a ```json ... ``` block with the `prompt_name` and `arguments`.
-   **Clarifying Question:** Only ask if information is truly missing.

[model]: Understood. I will follow all instructions.
[user]: which databases are on the system?
[model]: Thought: To get a list of databases, I will use the `base_databaseList` tool.

```json
{

}
```

[user]: You have just received data from a tool call. Review the data and your instructions to decide the next step.

1.  **Consider a Chart:** First, review the `--- Charting Rules ---` in your system prompt. Based on the data you just received, would a chart be an appropriate and helpful way to visualize the information for the user?

2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If a chart is appropriate, your next action is to call the correct chart-generation tool. Respond with only the `Thought:` and ```json...``` block for that tool.
    -   If a chart is **not** appropriate and you have all the information needed to answer the user's request, you should provide the final answer. Your response **MUST** start with `FINAL_ANSWER:`.
    -   If you still need more information from other tools, call the next appropriate tool.

    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

**Example of CORRECT Multi-Step Plan:**
    -   USER: "what is the system utilization in number of queries for today?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 1): "The user is asking about 'today'. I do not know the current date. My first step must be to get the current date from the database."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 1):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "base_readQuery",
          "arguments": {{ "sql": "SELECT CURRENT_DATE" }}
        }}
        ```
    -   TOOL RESPONSE (Step 1): `{{"results": [{{"Date": "2025-07-29"}}]}}`
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 2): "The database returned the current date as 2025-07-29. Now I can use this date to answer the user's original question about system utilization."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 2):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
          "arguments": {{ "date": "2025-07-29" }}
        }}
        ```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully. If it indicates an invalid column, parameter, or dimension (e.g., 'Column not found'), identify the specific argument that caused the failure.
2.  **Consult Tool Docs:** Review the documentation for the failed tool that is provided in this system prompt.
3.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Your next thought process should explain the error and propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
4.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
5.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

**Example of CORRECT Multi-Step Plan:**
    -   USER: "what is the system utilization in number of queries for today?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 1): "The user is asking about 'today'. I do not know the current date. My first step must be to get the current date from the database."

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully. If it indicates an invalid column, parameter, or dimension (e.g., 'Column not found'), identify the specific argument that caused the failure.
2.  **Consult Tool Docs:** Review the documentation for the failed tool that is provided in this system prompt.
3.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Your next thought process should explain the error and propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
4.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
5.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- Current User Prompt ---
what is the quality of Equipment?

2025-07-30 11:23:58,714 - --- RESPONSE ---
Thought: To assess the quality of the Equipment table, I will use the `qlty_columnSummary` tool.

--------------------------------------------------

2025-07-30 11:23:58,939 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: c31e0f18-20e8-4fae-a89a-a4f870ed973d) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

**Example of CORRECT Multi-Step Plan:**
    -   USER: "what is the system utilization in number of queries for today?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 1): "The user is asking about 'today'. I do not know the current date. My first step must be to get the current date from the database."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 1):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "base_readQuery",
          "arguments": {{ "sql": "SELECT CURRENT_DATE" }}
        }}
        ```
    -   TOOL RESPONSE (Step 1): `{{"results": [{{"Date": "2025-07-29"}}]}}`
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 2): "The database returned the current date as 2025-07-29. Now I can use this date to answer the user's original question about system utilization."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 2):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "dba_resusageSummary",
          "arguments": {{ "date": "2025-07-29" }}
        }}
        ```

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully. If it indicates an invalid column, parameter, or dimension (e.g., 'Column not found'), identify the specific argument that caused the failure.
2.  **Consult Tool Docs:** Review the documentation for the failed tool that is provided in this system prompt.
3.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Your next thought process should explain the error and propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
4.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
5.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.

--- **Charting Rules** ---
- Charting is disabled. Do NOT use any charting tools.

Thought: The error message indicates that the table "Equipment" does not exist.  I need to re-prompt for clarification.

```
I apologize, but I encountered an error.  The query to assess the quality of the "Equipment" table failed because the table does not appear to exist.  Could you please double-check the table name?  If it's correct, could you tell me the correct database name as well?

--------------------------------------------------

2025-07-30 11:23:59,836 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: c31e0f18-20e8-4fae-a89a-a4f870ed973d) ---
--- History ---
[user]: You are a specialized assistant for interacting with a Teradata database. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best tool, prompt, or sequence of tools.

--- **Core Reasoning Hierarchy** ---
1.  **Check for a Perfect Prompt:** First, analyze the user's request and see if there is a single, pre-defined **prompt** that exactly matches the user's intent and scope.
2.  **Synthesize a Plan from Tools:** If no single prompt is a perfect match, you must become a **planner**. Create a logical sequence of steps to solve the user's request.
3.  **Execute the First Step:** Your response will be the JSON for the *first tool* in your plan.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: CONTEXT and PARAMETER INFERENCE** ---
You **MUST** remember and reuse information from previous turns.
**Example of CORRECT Inference:**
    -   USER (Turn 1): "what is the business description for the `equipment` table in database `DEMO_Customer360_db`?"
    -   ASSISTANT (Turn 1): (Executes the request)
    -   USER (Turn 2): "ok now what is the quality of that table?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Turn 2): "The user is asking about 'that table'. The previous turn mentioned the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database. I will reuse these parameters."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Turn 2): `json ...` for `qlty_columnSummary` with `db_name`: `DEMO_Customer360_db` and `table_name`: `equipment`.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL ARGUMENT ADHERENCE** ---
You **MUST** use the exact parameter names provided in the tool definitions. Do not invent or guess parameter names.

--- **CRITICAL RULE: SQL GENERATION** ---
When using the `base_readQuery` tool, if you know the database name, you **MUST** use fully qualified table names in your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).

--- **CRITICAL RULE: HANDLING TIME-SENSITIVE QUERIES** ---
If the user asks a question involving a relative date (e.g., 'today', 'yesterday', 'this week'), you do not know this information. Your first step **MUST** be to find the current date before proceeding.

**Example of CORRECT Multi-Step Plan:**
    -   USER: "what is the system utilization in number of queries for today?"
    -   YOUR CORRECT REASONING (Step 1): "The user is asking about 'today'. I do not know the current date. My first step must be to get the current date from the database."
    -   YOUR CORRECT ACTION (Step 1):
        ```json
        {{
          "tool_name": "base_readQuery",
          "arguments": {{ "sql": "SELECT CURRENT_DATE" }}
        }}

--- **CRITICAL RULE: TOOL FAILURE AND RECOVERY** ---
If a tool call fails with an error message, you **MUST** attempt to recover. Your recovery process is as follows:
1.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the error message carefully. If it indicates an invalid column, parameter, or dimension (e.g., 'Column not found'), identify the specific argument that caused the failure.
2.  **Consult Tool Docs:** Review the documentation for the failed tool that is provided in this system prompt.
3.  **Formulate a New Plan:** Your next thought process should explain the error and propose a corrected tool call. Typically, this means re-issuing the tool call *without* the single failing parameter.
4.  **Retry the Tool:** Execute the corrected tool call.
5.  **Ask for Help:** Only if the corrected tool call also fails should you give up and ask the user for clarification.
