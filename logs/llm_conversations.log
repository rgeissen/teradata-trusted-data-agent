2025-08-20 15:29:47,287 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 7d0b5840-f937-4161-84c7-ab94a58fd5b1) ---
--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Analyzing user query to determine the first action.

--- History ---


--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

--- Your Decision Process ---
1.  **Analyze the situation:** Your primary goal is to gather all necessary data to comprehensively answer the user's question. You may need to call several tools in sequence.
2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If you need more information to answer the question, call another tool or prompt by providing the appropriate JSON block.
    -   If you are confident that you have now gathered **all** the necessary data from this and any previous tool calls, your response **MUST** be only the exact string `SYSTEM_ACTION_COMPLETE`. This will signal the final report writer to begin.
    -   If the last tool call resulted in an error, you MUST attempt to recover by calling a corrected tool.

SYSTEM_ACTION_COMPLETE
--------------------------------------------------

2025-08-20 15:29:51,284 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 7d0b5840-f937-4161-84c7-ab94a58fd5b1) ---
--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Generating final summary from collected tool data.

--- History ---
[user]: how many databases are on the system?
[assistant]: {"tool_name": "base_databaseList", "arguments": {}}

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

--- YOUR INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Adopt the Persona of a Data Analyst:** Your goal is to provide a holistic analysis and deliver actionable insights, not just report numbers.
2.  **Go Beyond the Obvious:** Start with the primary findings (like data completeness or null counts), but then scrutinize the data for secondary insights, patterns, or anomalies. For a data quality assessment, this could include looking for unexpected distributions, a lack of negative values in numeric columns where appropriate, or other indicators of high-quality data.
3.  **Structure Your Answer:** Begin with a high-level summary that directly answers the user's question. Then, if applicable, use bullet points to highlight key, specific observations from the data.
4.  **CRITICAL:** Your entire response **MUST** begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by your natural language summary. Do not add any other text before this prefix.


2025-08-20 15:29:51,284 - --- RESPONSE ---
FINAL_ANSWER: The Teradata system contains a total of 50 databases. These databases include a mix of system databases and user databases, each serving different purposes. Here are some key observations from the collected data:

- **System Databases:** Many databases, such as `TD_SYSXML`, `SYSLIB`, and `SQLJ`, are system databases that likely contain system-level data and configurations.
- **User Databases:** There are several user databases, such as `mldb` and `demo_user`, which are likely used for application-specific data storage.
- **Comment Strings:** Some databases have comment strings that provide additional context, such as `CREATED_BY` information for demonstration databases.
- **Database Types:** The databases are categorized into `DataBase` and `User` types, indicating their primary use cases.

This comprehensive list of databases suggests a well-organized system with clear distinctions between system and user data storage.

2025-08-20 15:29:58,896 - --- FULL CONTEXT (Session: 7d0b5840-f937-4161-84c7-ab94a58fd5b1) ---
--- REASON FOR CALL ---
Analyzing user query to determine the first action.

--- History ---
[user]: how many databases are on the system?
[assistant]: {"tool_name": "base_databaseList", "arguments": {}}

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

[assistant]: {"tool_name": "base_tableList", "arguments": {"database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db"}}

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:
You are an assistant responsible for coordinating a data gathering plan. Your task is to decide if enough data has been collected to answer the user's question.

--- User's Original Question ---
'what's in DEMO_Customer360_db?'

--- All Data Collected So Far ---
• Tool `base_tableList` returned 2 rows of data.

--- Data from Last Tool Call ---
{"tool_name": "base_tableList", "tool_output": {"status": "success", "metadata": {"tool_name": "base_tableList", "sql": "select TableName from dbc.TablesV tv where UPPER(tv.DatabaseName) = UPPER(NULL) and tv.TableKind in ('T','V', 'O', 'Q');\n", "columns": [{"name": "TableName", "type": "str"}], "row_count": 2}, "results": [{"TableName": "Equipment"}, {"TableName": "CallCenter"}]}}

--- Your Decision Process ---
1.  **Analyze the situation:** Your primary goal is to gather all necessary data to comprehensively answer the user's question. You may need to call several tools in sequence.
2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If you need more information to answer the question, call another tool or prompt by providing the appropriate JSON block.
    -   If you are confident that you have now gathered **all** the necessary data from this and any previous tool calls, your response **MUST** be only the exact string `SYSTEM_ACTION_COMPLETE`. This will signal the final report writer to begin.
    -   If the last tool call resulted in an error, you MUST attempt to recover by calling a corrected tool.

SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

--- YOUR INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Adopt the Persona of a Data Analyst:** Your goal is to provide a holistic analysis and deliver actionable insights, not just report numbers.
2.  **Go Beyond the Obvious:** Start with the primary findings (like data completeness or null counts), but then scrutinize the data for secondary insights, patterns, or anomalies. For a data quality assessment, this could include looking for unexpected distributions, a lack of negative values in numeric columns where appropriate, or other indicators of high-quality data.
3.  **Structure Your Answer:** Begin with a high-level summary that directly answers the user's question. Then, if applicable, use bullet points to highlight key, specific observations from the data.
4.  **CRITICAL:** Your entire response **MUST** begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by your natural language summary. Do not add any other text before this prefix.


2025-08-20 15:30:02,140 - --- RESPONSE ---
FINAL_ANSWER: The `DEMO_Customer360_db` database contains two tables: `Equipment` and `CallCenter`. Here are some key insights:

- **Table Presence**: The database houses a limited number of tables, suggesting a focused dataset likely designed for specific analytical purposes.
- **Table Names**: The names `Equipment` and `CallCenter` indicate that the database may be oriented towards customer service or asset management, potentially tracking customer interactions and equipment details.
- **Data Quality**: Given the limited number of tables, it is advisable to perform further data quality checks on these tables to ensure the integrity and reliability of the data for analysis.
- **Potential Use Cases**: The presence of these tables suggests potential use cases such as customer support analysis, equipment maintenance tracking, or integration with customer relationship management systems.

For a comprehensive understanding, further exploration of the schema and data within these tables is recommended.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:
You are an assistant responsible for coordinating a data gathering plan. Your task is to decide if enough data has been collected to answer the user's question.

--- User's Original Question ---
'give me the attributes of equipment'

--- All Data Collected So Far ---
• Tool `base_columnDescription` returned 9 rows of data.

--- Data from Last Tool Call ---
{"tool_name": "base_columnDescription", "tool_output": {"status": "success", "metadata": {"tool_name": "base_columnDescription", "database": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "object": "equipment", "column_count": 9}, "results": [{"TableName": "Equipment", "ColumnName": "FIRSTNAME", "CType": "VARCHAR"}, {"TableName": "Equipment", "ColumnName": "ADDRESS", "CType": "VARCHAR"}, {"TableName": "Equipment", "ColumnName": "STATE", "CType": "VARCHAR"}, {"TableName": "Equipment", "ColumnName": "CITY", "CType": "VARCHAR"}, {"TableName": "Equipment", "ColumnName": "EQUIP_LTV", "CType": "SMALLINT"}, {"TableName": "Equipment", "ColumnName": "ZIP", "CType": "INTEGER"}, {"TableName": "Equipment", "ColumnName": "LASTNAME", "CType": "VARCHAR"}, {"TableName": "Equipment", "ColumnName": "GENDER", "CType": "VARCHAR"}, {"TableName": "Equipment", "ColumnName": "CUST_ID", "CType": "SMALLINT"}]}}

--- Your Decision Process ---
1.  **Analyze the situation:** Your primary goal is to gather all necessary data to comprehensively answer the user's question. You may need to call several tools in sequence.
2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If you need more information to answer the question, call another tool or prompt by providing the appropriate JSON block.
    -   If you are confident that you have now gathered **all** the necessary data from this and any previous tool calls, your response **MUST** be only the exact string `SYSTEM_ACTION_COMPLETE`. This will signal the final report writer to begin.
    -   If the last tool call resulted in an error, you MUST attempt to recover by calling a corrected tool.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

--- YOUR INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Adopt the Persona of a Data Analyst:** Your goal is to provide a holistic analysis and deliver actionable insights, not just report numbers.
2.  **Go Beyond the Obvious:** Start with the primary findings (like data completeness or null counts), but then scrutinize the data for secondary insights, patterns, or anomalies. For a data quality assessment, this could include looking for unexpected distributions, a lack of negative values in numeric columns where appropriate, or other indicators of high-quality data.
3.  **Structure Your Answer:** Begin with a high-level summary that directly answers the user's question. Then, if applicable, use bullet points to highlight key, specific observations from the data.
4.  **CRITICAL:** Your entire response **MUST** begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by your natural language summary. Do not add any other text before this prefix.

- `FIRSTNAME` (VARCHAR): Likely stores the first name of the customer associated with the equipment.
- `ADDRESS` (VARCHAR): Stores the address related to the equipment.
- `STATE` (VARCHAR): Stores the state related to the equipment.
- `CITY` (VARCHAR): Stores the city related to the equipment.
- `EQUIP_LTV` (SMALLINT): Likely represents the loan-to-value ratio for the equipment, indicating the financial aspect.
- `ZIP` (INTEGER): Stores the ZIP code related to the equipment.
- `LASTNAME` (VARCHAR): Likely stores the last name of the customer associated with the equipment.
- `GENDER` (VARCHAR): Stores the gender of the customer associated with the equipment.
- `CUST_ID` (SMALLINT): Likely represents the customer ID, linking the equipment to a specific customer.

**Key Observations:**
- The table contains a mix of personal information (names, addresses) and financial metrics (EQUIP_LTV).
- The use of `VARCHAR` for address-related fields (`ADDRESS`, `STATE`, `CITY`) and personal information (`FIRSTNAME`, `LASTNAME`, `GENDER`) is standard.
- The numeric fields (`EQUIP_LTV`, `ZIP`, `CUST_ID`) are appropriately typed as `SMALLINT` or `INTEGER`, which is suitable for their expected data ranges.
- The presence of both `FIRSTNAME` and `LASTNAME` suggests that the table may be designed to store detailed customer information alongside equipment data.
- The `EQUIP_LTV` field indicates that the table may be used for financial analysis or credit assessment related to equipment.

This comprehensive view of the `equipment` table attributes provides a clear understanding of the data structure and potential uses within the database.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

USER PROMPT:
You are an assistant responsible for coordinating a data gathering plan. Your task is to decide if enough data has been collected to answer the user's question.

--- User's Original Question ---
'give me the distinct categories of state'

--- All Data Collected So Far ---
• Tool `qlty_distinctCategories` returned 4 rows of data.

--- Data from Last Tool Call ---
{"tool_name": "qlty_distinctCategories", "tool_output": {"status": "success", "metadata": {"tool_name": "qlty_distinctCategories", "database_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db", "table_name": "DEMO_Customer360_db.equipment", "column_name": "state", "distinct_categories": 4}, "results": [{"ColumnName": "STATE", "DistinctValue": "OH", "DistinctValueCount": "29"}, {"ColumnName": "STATE", "DistinctValue": "NY", "DistinctValueCount": "22"}, {"ColumnName": "STATE", "DistinctValue": "WV", "DistinctValueCount": "13"}, {"ColumnName": "STATE", "DistinctValue": "PA", "DistinctValueCount": "36"}]}}

--- Your Decision Process ---
1.  **Analyze the situation:** Your primary goal is to gather all necessary data to comprehensively answer the user's question. You may need to call several tools in sequence.
2.  **Choose Your Action:**
    -   If you need more information to answer the question, call another tool or prompt by providing the appropriate JSON block.
    -   If you are confident that you have now gathered **all** the necessary data from this and any previous tool calls, your response **MUST** be only the exact string `SYSTEM_ACTION_COMPLETE`. This will signal the final report writer to begin.
    -   If the last tool call resulted in an error, you MUST attempt to recover by calling a corrected tool.

--- Current User Prompt (with System Prompt) ---
SYSTEM PROMPT:

# Core Directives
You are a specialized assistant for a Teradata database system. Your primary goal is to fulfill user requests by selecting the best capability (a tool or a prompt) from the categorized lists provided and supplying all necessary arguments.

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a single JSON object for a tool/prompt call OR a single plain text string for a final answer.

1.  **Tool/Prompt Calls (JSON format):**
    -   If the capability is a prompt, you MUST use the key `"prompt_name"`.
    -   If the capability is a tool, you MUST use the key `"tool_name"`.
    -   Provide all required arguments. Infer values from the conversation history if necessary.
    -   Example (Prompt): `{"prompt_name": "some_prompt", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`
    -   Example (Tool): `{"tool_name": "some_tool", "arguments": {"arg": "value"}}`

2.  **Final Answer (Plain Text format):**
    -   When you have sufficient information to fully answer the user's request, you MUST stop using tools.
    -   Your response MUST begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by a natural language summary.
    -   Example: `FINAL_ANSWER: I found 48 databases on the system. The details are displayed below.`

# Decision Process
To select the correct capability, you MUST follow this two-step process, governed by one critical rule:

**CRITICAL RULE: Prioritize Specificity and Arguments.** Your primary filter for selecting a capability is its specificity. You MUST select the most granular capability that uses the most entities from the user's request (e.g., prefer a tool that uses a `table_name` over one that only uses a `database_name` if a table is mentioned). For direct actions and single analyses, you MUST select a `tool_name`; only select a `prompt_name` for broad, multi-step tasks explicitly described by the prompt.

1.  **Identify the Category:** First, analyze the user's request to determine which Tool or Prompt Category is the most relevant to their intent. The available categories are listed in the "Capabilities" section below.
2.  **Select the Capability:** Second, from within that single most relevant category, select the best tool or prompt to fulfill the request, adhering to the Critical Rule above.

# Best Practices
- **Context is Key:** Always use information from previous turns to fill in arguments like `db_name` or `table_name`.
- **Error Recovery:** If a tool fails, analyze the error message and attempt to call the tool again with corrected parameters. Only ask the user for clarification if you cannot recover.
- **SQL Generation:** When using the `base_readQuery` tool, you MUST use fully qualified table names in your SQL (e.g., `SELECT ... FROM my_database.my_table`).
- **Time-Sensitive Queries:** For queries involving relative dates (e.g., 'today', 'this week'), you MUST use the `util_getCurrentDate` tool first to determine the current date before proceeding.
- **Out of Scope:** If the user's request is unrelated to the available capabilities, respond with a `FINAL_ANSWER:` that politely explains you cannot fulfill the request and restates your purpose.
- **CRITICAL: Avoid Repetitive Behavior.** You are a highly intelligent agent. Do not get stuck in a loop by repeating the same tool calls or by cycling through the same set of tools. Once a tool has returned a successful result with data that is relevant to the user's request, do not call that same tool again unless there is a new and compelling reason to do so. If you have called a series of tools and believe you have enough information, you must call a FINAL_ANSWER. Do not repeat tool calls just to be "through".

2. Store user query (with /rag prefix stripping)
3. Generate query embeddings (tokenization + embedding)
4. Perform semantic search against chunk embeddings
5. Return retrieved context chunks for answer generation

The function uses configuration values from rag_config.yml with fallback defaults.

Arguments:
  question - user question to process
  k - number of top-k results to return (optional, uses config default if not provided)

Returns:
  Returns the top-k most relevant chunks with metadata for context-grounded answer generation.

- `rag_executeWorkflow_ivsm` (tool): 
Execute complete RAG workflow to answer user questions based on document context.

This function handles the entire RAG pipeline using IVSM functions:
1. Configuration setup (using configurable values from rag_config.yml)
2. Store user query (with /rag prefix stripping)
3. Tokenize query using ivsm.tokenizer_encode
4. Create embedding view using ivsm.IVSM_score
5. Convert embeddings to vector columns using ivsm.vector_to_columns
6. Perform semantic search against chunk embeddings

The function uses configuration values from rag_config.yml with fallback defaults.

Arguments:
  question - user question to process
  k - number of top-k results to return (optional, uses config default if not provided

Returns:
  Returns the top-k most relevant chunks with metadata for context-grounded answer generation.

- `cust_activeUsers` (tool): Fetch currently active database users
- `viz_createChart` (tool): Generates a data visualization based on provided data. You must specify the chart type and map the data fields to the appropriate visual roles.
  - Arguments:
    - `chart_type` (string, required): The type of chart to generate (e.g., 'bar', 'pie', 'line', 'scatter'). This MUST be one of the types listed in the 'Charting Guidelines'.
    - `data` (list[dict], required): The data to be visualized, passed directly from the output of another tool.
    - `title` (string, required): A descriptive title for the chart.
    - `mapping` (dict, required): A dictionary that maps data keys to chart axes or roles (e.g., {'x_axis': 'product_name', 'y_axis': 'sales_total'}). The required keys for this mapping depend on the selected chart_type.
- `util_getCurrentDate` (tool): Returns the current system date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Use this as the first step for any user query involving relative dates like 'today', 'yesterday', or 'this week'.
- `CoreLLMTask` (tool): Performs internal, LLM-driven tasks that are not direct calls to the Teradata database. This tool is used for text synthesis, summarization, and formatting based on a specific 'task_description' provided by the LLM itself.
  - Arguments:
    - `task_description` (string, required): A natural language description of the internal task to be executed (e.g., 'describe the table in a business context', 'format final output'). The LLM infers this from the workflow plan.
    - `source_data` (list[string], required): A list of keys (e.g., 'result_of_phase_1') identifying which data from the workflow history is relevant for this task. This is critical for providing the correct context.

--- YOUR INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  **Adopt the Persona of a Data Analyst:** Your goal is to provide a holistic analysis and deliver actionable insights, not just report numbers.
2.  **Go Beyond the Obvious:** Start with the primary findings (like data completeness or null counts), but then scrutinize the data for secondary insights, patterns, or anomalies. For a data quality assessment, this could include looking for unexpected distributions, a lack of negative values in numeric columns where appropriate, or other indicators of high-quality data.
3.  **Structure Your Answer:** Begin with a high-level summary that directly answers the user's question. Then, if applicable, use bullet points to highlight key, specific observations from the data.
4.  **CRITICAL:** Your entire response **MUST** begin with the exact prefix `FINAL_ANSWER:`, followed by your natural language summary. Do not add any other text before this prefix.

FINAL_ANSWER: The analysis of the `equipment` table in the `DEMO_Customer360_db` database reveals that there are four distinct categories for the `state` column. These states are Ohio (OH), New York (NY), West Virginia (WV), and Pennsylvania (PA). The distribution of equipment across these states is as follows: Ohio has 29 entries, New York has 22 entries, West Virginia has 13 entries, and Pennsylvania has 36 entries. 

Key observations:
- **Pennsylvania** has the highest number of entries, indicating a potentially higher concentration of equipment or operations in this state.
- **West Virginia** has the lowest number of entries, which might suggest a smaller operational presence or different business priorities in this state.
- The presence of only four states suggests a regional focus for the data, possibly indicating a targeted market or operational area.
- The distribution of entries across the states appears relatively balanced, with no state having an overwhelmingly large number of entries compared to the others. This could indicate a well-distributed operational strategy across the included states.
